\textbf{The relative merger speed of the two subclusters is estimated to be
3400~\kilo\meter~\second$^{-1}$ at the time of collision.} The two
subclusters are estimated to slow down to a 3D relative velocity of only
$\sim800$ \kilo\meter~\second$^{-1}$  at the time of observation. Based on
this time evolution of the $v_{3D}$, it is unlikely that El Gordo is a slow
merger as mentioned in \citet{M11}.
