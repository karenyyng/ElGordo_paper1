Paper to be submitted to MNRAS in mid March

Aimming for another review in late Feb among group members and Davis collaborators for finalizing the methodology and results sections.

Computation Tasks sorted by priority  
=====
*  Test sensitivity of polarization prior (over the weekend)
*  rerun MCMC with suitable acceptance rate / variance (early next week) 
*  rerun MCMAC with updated data (late next week) 
*  Grab Will 's code / modify it for plotting all the simulation outputs
  (late next week) 
*  make picture with locations of subclusters, center of mass and
   pericenters
* (optional) make use of SVM for classification of subcluster members 

Writing Tasks sorted by priority  
=====
*  incorporate comments from Tues group meetings to paper
*  Modify polarization section (over the weekend) 
*  Write result sections  
*  add stuff to appendix this should be quick
