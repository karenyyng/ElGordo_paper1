Paper to be submitted to MNRAS in mid March

Aimming for a review on Feb 11 among group members and Davis collaborators
on the methodology and results sections.

Computation Tasks sorted by priority  
=====
* Test sensitivity of polarization prior (over the weekend)
* rerun MCMC with suitable acceptance rate / variance (early next week) 
* rerun MCMAC with updated data (late next week) 
* Grab Will 's code / modify it for plotting all the simulation outputs
  (late next week) 

Writing Tasks sorted by priority  
=====
* Add finish touches to section 2.4 and 3.2 (have to talk to Dave) 
* Write sensitivity analysis section (over the weekend )  
* Modify polarization section (over the weekend) 
* Write result sections  
* add stuff to appendix this should be quick
