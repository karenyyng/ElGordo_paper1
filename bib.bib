abstract = {(Abridged) We present a HST weak-lensing study of the merging galaxy cluster "El Gordo" (ACT-CL J0102-4915) at z=0.87 discovered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration as the strongest SZ decrement in its \~{}1000 sq. deg survey. Our weak-lensing analysis confirms that ACT-CL J0102-4915 is indeed an extreme system consisting of two massive (\~{}10\^{}15 Msun each) subclusters with a projected separation of \~{}0.7 Mpc. This binary mass structure revealed by our lensing study is consistent with the cluster galaxy distribution and the dynamical study carried out with 89 spectroscopic members. We estimate the mass of ACT-CL J0102-4915 by simultaneously fitting two axisymmetric NFW profiles allowing their centers to vary. Our MCMC analysis shows that the masses of the northwestern (NW) and the southeastern (SE) components are M200c=(1.40+-0.31) x 10\^{}15 Msun and (0.75+-0.17) x 10\^{}15 Msun, respectively. The lensing-based velocity dispersions are consistent with their spectroscopic measurements. The centroids of both components are tightly constrained (\~{}4") and close to the optical luminosity centers. The X-ray and mass peaks are spatially offset by \~{}13" (\~{}100 kpc), which is significant at the \~{}3 sigma confidence level and confirms that the baryonic and dark matter in this cluster are disassociated. The dark matter peak, however, does not lead the gas peak in the direction expected if we are viewing the cluster soon after first core passage during a high speed merger. Under the assumption that the merger is happening in the plane of the sky, extrapolation of the two NFW halos to a radius r200a=2.4 Mpc yields a combined mass of M200a=(3.10+-0.70) x 10\^{}15 Msun. This extrapolated total mass is consistent with our two-component-based dynamical analysis and previous X-ray measurements, projecting ACT-CL J0102-4915 to be the most massive cluster at z>0.6 known to date.},

abstract = {This paper is the second in a series describing the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) being carried out at 843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). The survey will consist of [\~{}]590 4.3\{degrees\}x 4.3\{degrees\} mosaic images with 45 x 45 cosec|\{delta\}| arcsec2 resolution, and a source catalogue. In this paper we describe the initial release (version 1.0) of the source catalogue consisting of 107 765 radio sources made by fitting elliptical Gaussians in 271 SUMSS 4.3\{degrees\}x 4.3\{degrees\} mosaics to a limiting peak brightness of 6 mJy beam-1 at \{delta\}[\&le;]-50\{degrees\} and 10 mJy beam-1 at \{delta\} > -50\{degrees\}. The catalogue covers approximately 3500 deg2 of the southern sky with \{delta\}[\&le;]-30\{degrees\}, about 43 per cent of the total survey area. Positions in the catalogue are accurate to within 1-2 arcsec for sources with peak brightness A843[\&ge;] 20 mJy beam-1 and are always better than 10 arcsec. The internal flux density scale is accurate to within 3 per cent. Image artefacts have been classified using a decision tree, which correctly identifies and rejects spurious sources in over 96 per cent of cases. Analysis of the catalogue shows that it is highly uniform and is complete to 8 mJy at \{delta\}[\&le;]-50\{degrees\} and 18 mJy at \{delta\} > -50\{degrees\}. In this release of the catalogue about 7000 sources are found in the overlap region with the National Radio Astronomy Observatories Very Large Array Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz. We calculate a median spectral index of =-0.83 between 1.4 GHz and 843 MHz. This version of the catalogue will be released via the World Wide Web with future updates as new mosaics are released.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters form through a sequence of mergers of smaller galaxy clusters and groups. Models of diffusive shock acceleration suggest that in shocks that occur during cluster mergers, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, similar to conditions within supernova remnants. In the presence of magnetic fields, these particles emit synchrotron radiation and may form so-called radio relics. We detected a radio relic that displays highly aligned magnetic fields, a strong spectral index gradient, and a narrow relic width, giving a measure of the magnetic field in an unexplored site of the universe. Our observations show that diffusive shock acceleration also operates on scales much larger than in supernova remnants and that shocks in galaxy clusters are capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays.},

abstract = {Merging galaxy clusters have become one of the most important probes of dark matter, providing evidence for dark matter over modified gravity and even constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section. To properly constrain the dark matter cross-section it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the merger, as the inferred cross-section is a function of both the velocity of the collision and the observed time since collision. While the best understanding of merging system dynamics comes from N-body simulations, these are computationally intensive and often explore only a limited volume of the merger phase space allowed by observed parameter uncertainty. Simple analytic models exist but the assumptions of these methods invalidate their results near the collision time, plus error propagation of the highly correlated merger parameters is unfeasible. To address these weaknesses I develop a Monte Carlo method to discern the properties of dissociative mergers and propagate the uncertainty of the measured cluster parameters in an accurate and Bayesian manner. I introduce this method, verify it against an existing hydrodynamic N-body simulation, and apply it to two known dissociative mergers: 1ES 0657-558 (Bullet Cluster) and DLSCL J0916.2+2951 (Musket Ball Cluster). I find that this method surpasses existing analytic models - providing accurate (10\% level) dynamic parameter and uncertainty estimates throughout the merger history. This coupled with minimal required a priori information (subcluster mass, redshift, and projected separation) and relatively fast computation (\~{}6 CPU hours) makes this method ideal for large samples of dissociative merging clusters.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 "El Gordo," likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect cluster known at z>0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg\^{}2. Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of Tx=14.5+/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of Lx=(2.19+/-0.11)x10\^{}45 h70\^{}-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of M200a=(2.16+/-0.32)x10\^{}15 M\_sun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6+/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22+/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {We present the first dynamical mass estimates and scaling relations for a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected galaxy clusters. The sample consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over a 455 sq. deg. area of the southern sky. Deep multi-object spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution (R\~{}700-800) spectra and redshifts for \~{}60 member galaxies on average per cluster. The dynamical masses M\_200c of the clusters have been calculated using simulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The sample has a median redshift z=0.50 and a median mass M\_200c\~{}12e14 Msun/h70 with a lower limit M\_200c\~{}6e14 Msun/h70, consistent with the expectations for the ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE properties of the sample, specifically, the match-filtered central SZE amplitude y, the central Compton parameter y0, and the integrated Compton signal Y\_200c, which we use to derive SZE-Mass scaling relations. All SZE estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (<\~{}20\%), in agreement with numerical simulations. We explore the effects of various systematic effects on these scaling relations, including the correlation between observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters. Using the 3-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters and find that \~{}50\% of the clusters are disturbed. There are hints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations but given the current sample sizes these differences are not significant; further studies including more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on the scaling relations.},
annote = {Cristobal Sifon: 
Will and I were discussing about the galaxy velocity data, and I thought I'd get the discussion started by providing you with a summary of what we've done already.

        
First, the spectroscopic campaign and analysis is described in detail in Sifon et al. (2013, ApJ, 772, 25), where El Gordo is treated as part of the ACT southern sample. You'll see there that we ran the DS test for each cluster (among other simple tests; see section 4.2 and Table 4), and we found that there is no evidence of merging in El Gordo from the galaxy velocities. We also looked at the fraction of emission-line galaxies (but did not quantify it as star formation) and it is nothing special compared to the other clusters (see histogram in Fig 3).

        

        
Just because I already did it, here is my code for the DS test with a couple dependencies that you'll need. The help file is fairly complete, but let me know if you need some help. All you need to do to get a result (including plot!) is

        

        
import dstest
out = dstest.Delta('ACT-J0102-4915.cat', z0=0.870, Nnear=10,                   cluster='El Gordo',
                   plot\_filename='dstest-10.png', output='dstest-10.out')

        
where "dstest-10.out" contains the individual delta's from the DS test for each galaxy. The attached catalog contains only the 89 members.

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies, as the largest virialized systems in the Universe, are ideal laboratories to study the formation and evolution of cosmic structures...(abridged)... Most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of ICM through X-ray Astronomy. At the same time, radio observations have proved that the ICM is mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium. They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in galaxy clusters: halos, relics and mini-halos. We discuss their classification and properties. We report published results up to date and obtain and discuss statistical properties. We present the properties of large-scale magnetic fields in clusters and in even larger structures: filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We summarize the current models of the origin of these cluster components, and outline the improvements that are expected in this area from future developments thanks to the new generation of radio telescopes.},

In some clusters of galaxies peripherally located sources of extended diffuse radio emission exist, the so-called cluster radio relics. They have steep radio spectra but no apparent cutoff, as old remnants of radio galaxies usually have. Therefore particle acceleration has to take place within them. We propose that shock structures of the cosmological large-scale matter flows are responsible for the acceleration of relativistic electrons: cluster accretion shocks and bow shocks of merger events. We develop a theory of radio plasma having traversed these shocks and compare it to observational data of nine radio relics (0038-096, 0917+75, 1140+203, 1253+275, 1712+64, 1706+78, 2006-56, 2010-57, 1401-33) and their host clusters (A85, A786, A1367, Coma, A2255, A2256, A3667, S753). The necessary accretion power, the spectral index of the radio spectrum, the acceleration efficiency of the shock, the diffusion coefficient in the post-shock region, and the predicted radio polarization in all of our examples fit into a coherent interpretation of the observational data. Since polarization measurements are available only for four sources, the predictions of our theory can be independently checked using other examples. The predicted values of the shock compression ratio, density and temperature of the infalling gas, magnetic field strength of the shocked and unshocked radio plasma are discussed within the frame of structure formation theory.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters grow by mergers with other clusters and galaxy groups. These mergers create shocks within the intracluster medium (ICM). It is proposed that within the shocks particles can be accelerated to extreme energies. In the presence of a magnetic field these particles should then form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation, creating so-called radio relics. An example of a cluster with relics is CIZA J2242.8+5301. Here we present hydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster collisions with the aim of constraining the merger scenario for this cluster. We conclude that by using the location, size and width of double radio relics we can set constraints on the mass ratios, impact parameters, timescales, and viewing geometries of binary cluster merger events.},

abstract = {Simulations of isolated binary mergers of galaxy clusters are a useful tool to study the evolution of these objects. For exceptionally massive systems they even represent the only viable way of simulation, because these are rare in typical cosmological simulations. We present a new practical model for these simulations based on the Hernquist dark matter profile. The hydrostatic equation is solved for a beta-model with \$\backslash beta\$ = 2/3 in this potential and approximate expressions for X-ray brightness and Compton-y parameter are derived. We show in detail how to setup such a system using SPH. The theoretical and several numerical models are compared to observed scaling relations of galaxy clusters and satisfactory agreement with the self-similar relations is found. The model is then applied to investigate the observed cluster ACT-CT J0102-4915 (El Gordo), a particularly massive merging high redshift cluster. We are able to reproduce the X-ray luminosity, SZ-effect and dark matter core distance as well as the rough shape of the observed cluster for reasonable model parameters. The lack of substruc- ture prevents us from obtaining the fluctuations observed in the wake of the system and we argue that the parent cluster of the system was highly disturbed even before the main merger observed today.},

By identifying merger shock waves in cosmological grid simulations, we explore several prescriptions for relating the energy dissipated in shocks to the energy emitted in the radio band. None of the investigated models produce detectable radio relics within 100-200 kpc from the cluster centre. All models cause > 50 per cent of the detectable relic emission at projected distances > 800 kpc. Central radio relics caused by shocks that propagate along the line-of-sight are rare events for simple geometrical reasons, and they have a low surface brightness making them elusive for current instruments. Our simulations show that the radial distribution of observed relics can be explained by the radial trend of dissipated kinetic energy in shocks, that increases with distance from the cluster centre up until half of the virial radius.},

> Hi Reinout and Marcus,

> For the poster we presented a few weeks ago, we used a hard prior of 0.5-1.5 Mpc for the relic radius to constrain El Gordo (the resulting figure is in Will's talk from Tuesday's meeting).  We would like to justify and fine tune this for a paper. A few questions to start with: do we know enough about El Gordo's gas density profile to fine-tune the 0.5-1.5 number?
        
Hi David 
>  A few questions to start with: do we know enough about El Gordo's gas density profile to fine-tune the 0.5-1.5 number?
        
Yes. I would use Fig. 4 Vazza et al. 2012 (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1720v1.pdf) as a starting point. So the radio relics are most likely located at 0.5R\_vir. 
> And what would be a more realistic cutoff than a hard cutoff at either end?
        
For El Gordo Menanteau et al. 2012 give R\_200=2.1 Mpc. The relics are located at \~{}2 arcmin from the cluster center \~{} 1 Mpc (projected radius). So this will be the lower -hard limit- on the relic distance. 
> Should the prior be peaked around 1.0 Mpc?
        
R200 \~{} 0.7R\_vir so the prior should peak around 1.5 Mpc. At max. I would expect the relics be located at 2 Mpc or so (beyond that seem more unlikely) A few more thoughts: If you believe the max. 30 degr inclination (viewing) angle from Menanteau et al. 2012 than this means that the actual relic distance can be at maximum 1.2 times the observed projected distance. Even if I taken an inclination of 50 degr this limits the distance of the relic to 1.5 Mpc. This strongly suggest the relics are located between 1.0-1.5 Mpc. The X-ray morphology of the system is probably also hard to explain for inclinations larger than \~{}50 degr (although simulations are needed here to provide more than handwaving numbers). Summarized: hard lower limit: 1 Mpc (=actual projected distance) peak prior: 1.5 Mpc (based on simulations from Vazza) outer limit: 2 Mpc (not a hard limit, based on simulations from Vazza) 1.0-1.5 Mpc range more likely than the 1.5-2.0 Mpc range (based on the shape of the curve in Fig. 4) (\& taking a viewing angle < 50 degr limits the range to 1.0 -1.5 Mpc.) 
        
        
My own notes 
R200c from 2D fit is 2.09 Mpc pm .21 Mpc 
        
So the virial radius is 2.09 / .7 = 2.98
so the range of .4 r\_vir to 1.0 R\_v 
converts to  1.19 Mpc < d < 2.98 Mpc

With the integrated line-of-sight gas density derived from new Chandra observations, our RM measurement implies B\_parallel\~{}0.01 $\backslash$mu G in the cluster outskirts. The extremely narrow shock widths in the relics (<23 kpc) prevent us from placing a meaningful constraint on |B| using cooling time arguments. In addition to the relics, we detect a large (1.1 Mpc radius), powerful (log L\_1.4[W/Hz]= 25.66+-0.05) radio halo with a Bullet-like morphology. The spectral-index map of the halo shows the synchrotron spectrum is flattest near the relics, along the collision axis, and in regions of high T\_gas, all locations associated with recent energy injection. The spatial and spectral correlation between the halo emission and cluster X-ray properties supports primary-electron processes like turbulent reacceleration as the halo production mechanism. The halo's integrated 610 MHz to 2.1 GHz spectral index is 1.25+-0.05, consistent with the cluster's high T\_gas in view of previously established global scaling relations. El Gordo is the highest-redshift cluster known to host a radio halo and/or radio relics, and provides new constraints on the non-thermal physics in clusters at z>0.6. [abridged]},

abstract = {We investigate the gravitational lensing properties of dark matter halos with Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) density profiles and derive an analytic expression for the radial dependence of the shear, \$\backslash gamma(x)\$, due to these objects. In addition, we derive an expression for the mean shear interior to a given radius, \$\backslash bar\{\backslash gamma\}(x)\$, and use this to quantify systematic errors that will arise in weak lensing mass estimates of astronomical objects in the case that the mass estimate is based on an a priori assumption that the underlying potential is that of a singular isothermal sphere when, in fact, the potential is that of an NFW-type object. On mass scales between \$10\^{}\{11\} \backslash Msun \backslash ls M\_\{200\} \backslash ls 10\^{}\{15\} \backslash Msun\$, the assumption of an isothermal sphere potential results in an overestimate of the halo mass, and the amount by which the mass is overestimated increases linearly with the value of the NFW concentration parameter. Considerable overestimates of the mass (\$\backslash sim 60\%\$) can occur for galaxy-sized halos, but for rich clusters the mass overestimate is small. The degree to which the mass is systematically in error is dependent upon the cosmology adopted, with a COBE-normalized standard CDM model yielding the largest systematic errors for a given true value of the halo mass.},
