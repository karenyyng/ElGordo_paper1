\begin{abstract} 
Merging galaxy clusters with radio relics provide rare insights to the merger
dynamics as the relics are created by the violent merger process. 
We demonstrate one of the first uses of the
properties of the radio relic to reduce the uncertainties of the dynamical variables 
and determine 3D configuration of a cluster merger, ACT-CL J0102-4915, El Gordo. 
From the double radio relic observation and the X-ray wake morphology, 
it is believed that El Gordo is observed shortly after the first
core-passage of the subclusters.
%At a redshift of 0.87, El Gordo (M$_{200c} = 
%2.75\times10^{15} \pm^{7.4}_{1.5}$ M$_{\sun}$) is one of the most massive
%clusters discovered in the early universe. The two subclusters of El
%Gordo has a mass ratio of around 2:1. 
%The X-ray and weak-lensing data of El Gordo show an offset of X kpc between
%the intracluster gas and the dark matter (DM) at $\sim$4 $\sigma$ level.
%All these features of El Gordo make it part of a valuable class of
%dissociative mergers that can probe the self-interaction of dark matter.
We employ a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the three-dimensional (3D)
configuration and dynamics of El Gordo. 
%and provide a summary of the probability
%density functions of the inferred variables.
By making use the polarization
fraction of the radio relic, we are able to constrain the estimate of the
angle between the sky and the merger axis to be $\alpha = 21\degree
\pm^9_{11}$. We find the relative 3D merger speed of El Gordo to be
$2400\pm^{400}_{200} ~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. We put our estimates of
the time-since-collision into context by showing that if the time-averaged
shock velocities $< 1100~ \kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ in the center of mass
frame, the two subclusters are more likely to be moving towards, rather
than away from each other. This merging scenario might help
explain why the southeast dark matter lensing peak of El Gordo is
closer to the merger center than the southeast galaxy number density peak. 
However, a more concrete
conclusion would require better knowledge of the time evolution of the
relic propagation speed. Finally, we provide a comparison of El Gordo with
other merging clusters such as the Bullet Cluster and the Musketball Cluster.

\section{Introduction} 
Mergers of dark-matter-dominated galaxy clusters probes properties
of the cluster components like no other systems. 
Clusters of galaxies are made up of $\sim80\%$ of dark matter in mass content, 
with a smaller  portion of intercluster gas($\sim15\%$ in mass content), and
sparsely spaced galaxies ($\sim2\%$ in mass content). During a merger of
clusters, the subclusters are accelerated to high speeds of several
thousand \kilo \meter~\second$^{-1}$. The offsets of
different components of the subclusters reflect the differences in the
strengths of interactions between various components. Galaxies are
expected to lead the gas due to its negligible interaction cross
sections with other components. The intracluster medium (ICM) is expected to lose
momentum through electromagnetic interactions. On the other hand, offsets
between dark matter and galaxies may suggest dark matter self-interaction
(\citealt{Kahlhoefer14}, \citealt{Randall2008d}).  
\par
El Gordo possesses a range of special features that allows us to constrain
the merger dynamics in multiple ways.  Ever since the discovery of El Gordo
in the Atacama Camera Telescope survey (ACT; \citealt{Marriage11}), there is an ongoing effort for
collecting comprehensive data for El Gordo.
From the spectroscopy and Dressler-Schecter test for the member galaxies
in \cite{Sifon13}, El Gordo is confirmed to be a binary merger 
without significant substructures. This picture is further supported by the
weak lensing analysis by \cite{Jee13}. The weak lensing analysis shows
a mass ratio of $\sim$2:1  between the two main subclusters, named according to their location as the northeast (NW) and southeast (SE) subclusters respectively. 
(See Figure~\ref{fig:config}). El Gordo has interesting intracluster medium morphology as shown in the X-ray. In the northwest, it shows a wake feature, i.e.,
turbulent flow due to object of higher density moving through fluids, while in the southeast, it shows
highest X-ray emissivity indicative of a cool gas core southeast of the
wake. The cool gas core may have passed from the northwest to the southeast
to have caused this morphology (\citealt{M12}, hereafter M12). 
The extended mass distribution of El Gordo also makes it a good
gravitational lens. \cite{Zitrin13} have found multiple strong
gravitationally lensed images around the center region of El Gordo. 
On the outskirt, strong radio emission is detected in
the NW and the SE respectively. These radio emission has steep spectral
index gradient and are identified as radio relic associated with shockwaves
created from a merger \citep{L13}.

El Gordo is one of the small samples of galaxy clusters ($\sim50$) that have
been associated with a radio relic and show dissociation between the X-ray
gas and the DM subclusters. Even fewer of them have been studied in
great details, making El Gordo a valuable candidate for further analysis.\par 
In this paper, we combine most of the available information of El Gordo
with the main goal of giving estimates of
the associated dynamical parameters after taking into account all available
constraints and reflecting uncertainties due to the missing variables.
Determining the time-since-collision of mergers of similar clusters helps
us reconstruct different stages of a cluster merger.
Mergers of clusters proceed on the time-scale of millions of year,
observations of each cluster only provides a snapshot of a particular type
of merger. In order to understand the merger process observationally, 
we need to identify different stages of similar dissociative mergers and
gather statistics to understand the physics of the mergers.  
Another crucial piece of missing information is the 3D
configuration, i.e. the angle between the plane of the sky and the merger
axis called the projection angle $\alpha$. Since most of the dynamical
observables are projected quantities while the modelling of physics
requires 3D
variables, the deprojection based on $\alpha$ contributes the
largest amount of uncertainties to the dynamical variables \citepalias{D13}.
From the morphology of the double relic of El Gordo, it is believed that
$\alpha$ should be small. For mergers with a
large projection angle, the radio emission would be projected towards the
center of the merger, which is hard to be detected \citep{Vazza11}.
However, the only quantitative constraints on $\alpha$ is from \cite{L13}
with a lower bound of $\alpha \geq 11.6 \degree$.  
\par 
We employ a data-driven approach that thoroughly probes parameter
space by directly drawing samples from the observables. 
This work based on Monte Carlo simulation is particularly important since
it is forbiddingly expensive to simulate and analyze clusters similar to El
Gordo in high resolution. Previous attempts at modeling El Gordo with hydrodynamical
simulations such as \cite{Donnert13} and \cite{Molnar14} provided only in
total a dozen possible configurations of El Gordo, which do not
reflect the input uncertainties. Another approach for
estimating dynamical parameters would be to look for multiple analogs of El Gordo in cosmological
simulations.  However, under the hierarchical picture
of structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM model, there is a rare chance
for massive clusters like El Gordo to have formed at a redshift of $z = 0.87$.  
The number density of analogs with mass comparable to El Gordo in a
cosmological simulation is as low as $10^{-11} \mega\text{pc}^{-3}$ \citepalias{M12}.  
\par
In the following sections, we adopt the following conventions: (1) we
assume the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_{m} = 0.3$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7$. (2) All confidence intervals are quoted at the 68\% level unless otherwise stated. 
(3) All credible intervals (a.k.a. Bayesian confidence intervals) are also
quoted at the 68\% level unless otherwise stated and are central credible
intervals. We adopt this terminology to remind readers of our Bayesian
interpretation of the probability density functions, and that we obtained
the intervals / regions are estimated by integrating the posterior
probability densities.  
(4) All quoted masses ($M_{200c}$) are based on mass contained
within $r_{200}$ where the mass density is 200 times the critical density
of the universe ($\rho_{crit}$) at the redshift of $z = 0.87$. 
\section{DATA} 
We gathered and analyzed data from multiple sources for different
purposes. For assigning membership of galaxies to the two identified subclusters, we
examined the spectroscopic data obtained from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and
Germini South as described in \citetalias{M12} and \citet{Sifon13}.
For the weak-lensing mass estimation, we used the published
Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) mass estimates from \citetalias{Jee13}.
See Table~\ref{tab:inputs} for descriptions of the probability density
functions (PDFs) of the input
variables. \par 
%and these galaxies were discussed as the population in Region A in
%\citetalias{Jee13}.  
In order to further constrain our parameter space, we referred to the properties of
the radio relics from \citet{L13}. El Gordo shows radio relics on the
periphery of both subclusters \citepalias{M12}. Two radio relics, the
northwest (NW) relic and the southeast (SE) relic, of El Gordo were first
discovered in the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) data in low
resolution at 843 MHz \citep{Mauch03} as shown in M12. A higher
resolution radio observation conducted by \cite{L13} at 610 \mega Hz and
2.1 \giga Hz later confirmed the identities of the NW and the SE relic, and
found another extended source of radio relic in the east (E) (See Fig.~\ref{fig:config}). Among the radio relics, the NW relic possesses the most extended geometry
(0.56 Mpc in length), and its physics, including the
polarization and Mach number were studied in the greatest detail. The E relic
was also reported to have a resolved length of 0.27 Mpc. 

\section{METHOD -- Monte Carlo simulation} 
We used the collisionless 
dark-matter-only Monte Carlo modeling code written by \citetalias{D13}, to compute the physics of between
the first and second core-passage of the DM subclusters. 
In the D13 code, the time evolution of the
head-on merger was computed based on an analytical, dissipationless model
assuming that the only dominant force is the gravitational attraction from
the masses of two truncated Naverro-Frenk-White (hereafter NFW) DM halos. 
In the simulation, many realizations of the collision is
computed by drawing random realizations of the probability density
functions (PDFs) of the inputs, including
the data ($\vec{D}$) and one model variable, the projection angle between
the plane of the sky and the merger axis, $\alpha$. In particular,
the required data, included the masses ($M_{200_{NW}},M_{200_{SE}}$) the
redshifts ($z_{NW}, z_{SE}$) and the projected separation of the two
subclusters ($d_{proj}$).  (See Table~\ref{tab:inputs}
for quantitative descriptions of the sample PDFs) 
Each set of inputs is then used for computing the output variables
($\vec{\theta}^\prime$) by making use of conservation of energy to describe
their collision due to the mutual gravitational attraction.
To ensure convergence of the output PDFs, in total, 2 million realizations
were computed. 
The results, however, are consistent up to a fraction of a percent just
from 20 000 runs \citepalias{D13}. The random sampling allows us to
throughly explore the multidimensional input parameter space and account
for the uncertainties of the inputs at the same time.
\par    
We adapt a Bayesian interpretation of the PDFs of the Monte Carlo
simulation. The Bayes chain rule that underlies the simulation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    P(M|\vec{D}) \propto P(\vec{D}|M)P(M),
\end{equation}
where the likelihood is defined to be the PDF of $\vec{D}$ given our
physical model $M$ which we parametrize using variables in Table 1
($\vec{\theta}$).
For example,the
calculation of the output variables of the $j$-th realization can be denoted as: 
\begin{equation}
    (\vec{\theta}^\prime)^{(j)} = f(\vec{\theta}^{(j)}, \vec{D}), 
\end{equation}    
and computed over all $j$ realizations. Finally, we took the physical
constraints on the dynamical variables into account by
examining the resulting physical variables against the physical limits and
excluding realizations that would produce impossible values. We refer to this
process of excluding unphysical realizations as applying priors. 
Even though we denote the priors for one dimension at a time (See Appendix~\ref{app:priors}), 
the correlations between different variables are properly taken into account
since we discarded all the variables of the problematic
realizations.\par 
The system of El Gordo satisfies several major assumptions in the Monte Carlo
simulation.
One of the strongest assumptions is that all realizations correspond to
gravitationally bound systems. The simulation excludes all realizations
that would result in relative collisional velocities of the subclusters
higher than the free-fall velocity. We justify our assumption of only
modeling gravitationally bound system by noting that the relative escape
velocity of the subclusters for El Gordo is
$4500~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ (based on the mass estimates of
\cite{Jee13}).Studies from cosmological simulations giving the PDFs of the pairwise velocities of massive merging clusters ($>
10^{15} M_{\sun}$) indicate that it is highly unlikely that the pairwise
velocities would $> 3000~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$ under $\Lambda$CDM.
(\citealt{Thompson12}, \citealt{Lee2010}).  Other major assumptions for
modeling systems with this code include negligible impact parameter. There
is a study indicating that the impact parameter of El Gordo
may be as large as $300$ kpc $ \approx 40\%~r_s$ \citep{Molnar14},
where $r_s$ is the characteristic core
radius of the NFW halo with the mass of the SE subcluster. According to
\cite{Ricker98}, the resulting remnant of bimodal cluster mergers would
have drastic differences only when the impact parameter $> 10~ r_{\text{core}}$.
\cite{Mastropietro2008a} also reported that an impact parameter of $0.1~
r_{200}$ affected merger dynamics only at the $\sim$10\% level.   
Other assumptions in this simulation include negligible dynamical friction
during the merger, negligible mass accretion and negligible self-interaction
of dark matter. Discussion of the effects of each of these assumptions are
included in \citetalias{D13}.

\subsection{Inputs of the Monte Carlo simulation} \label{sec: inputs}
\setcounter{table}{0} 
\input{input_table}
\subsubsection{Membership selection and redshift estimation of subclusters}
We adopted the identification of galaxy membership of El Gordo given by
\citetalias{M12} with a total count of 89 galaxies.
To further distinguish member galaxies of each subcluster, we first
converted the coordinates (01:03:22.0,
-49:12:32.9) and (01:02:35.1, -49:18:09.8) to pixel space to
avoid anarmorphic distortion. Then we performed a spatial cut using the
aforementioned two points in pixel space as the two ends of the cut. The
spatial cut is approximately perpendicular to the 2D merger axis and is consistent with
the bimodal number density contours (See Figure~\ref{fig:membership}). 
There are 51 members identified in the NW subclusters and 35 members in the SE
subclusters. 
After identifying members of each subcluster, we performed 10, 000 bootstrap realizations to estimate the biweight
locations of the spectroscopic redshifts of the respective members in order
to obtain the samples of the PDFs of the redshifts of each subcluster. 
The spectroscopic redshift of the subclusters were
determined to be 
%$z_{total} = \pm $ 
$z_{\mathrm{NW}} = 0.86842 \pm 0.0011$ and 
$z_{\mathrm{SE}} = 0.87131 \pm 0.0012$, where the quoted numbers represent the
biweight location and 1$\sigma$ bias-corrected confidence level
respectively \citep{Beers90}.  
Both the estimated redshifts of the subclusters and the uncertainties are
consistent with estimates of $z=0.8701 \pm 0.0009$ for El Gordo given by \citealt{Sifon13}, and the fact that the
member galaxies of El
Gordo shows large velocity dispersion and has the largest velocity
dispersion among all the ACT galaxy clusters as reported by
\citetalias{M12}.

We estimated the radial velocity differences of the
subclusters by first calculating the velocity of each subcluster with
respect to us, using  
\begin{equation}
	v_i = \left[ \frac{(1+z_i)^2 - 1 }{(1+z_i)^2 + 1 }\right]c,
\end{equation}
where $i=1, 2$ represents the two subclusters, and $c$ is the speed of
light. The radial velocity was calculated by: 
\begin{equation}
	\Delta v_{rad}(t_{obs}) = \frac{|v_2 - v_1|}{1-\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}.
\end{equation}
Due to the estimates of the subcluster redshifts are close to
one another with overlapping confidence intervals, we obtained a low 
radial velocity difference of the two subclusters to be
$476~\pm~242~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ (See Fig. \ref{fig:
bootstrap_redshift}). 
The quoted radial velocity differences of $586~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$ reported by \citetalias{M12} 
is higher than our estimates but within the 68\% bias-corrected
confidence interval. Limitations and possible improvements of this analysis
of $v_{rad}$ are provided in the discussion.

	member galaxies and the division of the member galaxies among the two subclusters of El Gordo by a spatial cut

spectroscopic values), with the redder end indicating higher
redshift. The background number density contours in green indicate a bimodal
distribution.}

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Weak lensing mass estimation} 
We obtained 40, 000 samples of the joint PDFs of the masses of the two dark
matter halos as the outputs of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
procedure from \citealt{Jee13}. Discussion of the handling of the weak
lensing source galaxies and the details the MCMC procedure for mass
estimation can be found in \citealt{Jee13}. 
\subsubsection{Estimation of projected separation ($d_{proj}$)} 
To be consistent with our MCMC mass inference, our Monte Carlo simulation takes 
the projected separation of the NFW halos to be those of the inferred
DM centroid locations in \citealt{Jee13}. We draw random samples
 of the location of centroids from two 2D Gaussians centered at
 RA=01:02:50.601, Decl.=-49:15:04.48 for the NW subcluster and RA =
 01:02:56.312, Decl. = -49:16:23.15 for the SE
subcluster, with a 1'' standard deviation each as estimated from the
convergence map of \citet{Jee13} . Or equivalently, the
samples of the inferred centroid locations correspond to a projected separation of
$0.74\pm {0.007}$ Mpc. 
\subsection{Outputs of the Monte Carlo simulation}\label{sec: outputs}
%\input{2.2_0_monte_carlo_outputs}

We outline the outputs of the simulation here to facilitate the discussion
of the design of the priors used in the simulation. The simulation
provides PDF estimates for 8 output variables. Variables
of highest interest include the time dependence and the angle $\alpha$, which is
defined to be the projection angle between the plane of the sky and the merger axis. Other output variables are dependent on $\alpha$ and the time
dependence. Specifically, the simulation denotes the time dependence by
providing several characteristic time-scales, including the time
elapsed between consecutive collisions
($T$) and the time-since-collision of the observed state ($TSC$).  

We provide two versions of the time-since-collision variables $TSC_0$ and
$TSC_1$ to denote different possible merger scenarios. 1) We call the scenario for which the subclusters are
moving apart after collision to be ``outgoing" and it corresponds to the
smaller $TSC_0$ value, and 2) we call the alternative scenario 
``returning" for which the subclusters are approaching each other after turning
around from the apoapsis for the first time and it corresponds to $TSC_1$.
We describe how we make use of properties of the radio relic to evalute
which scenario is more likely in
section~\ref{sec:positionprior}. Evolution of the merger after the second
passage is not considered. Outputs from our dissipationless simulation for
a ``second'' passage will not differ from the first passage.
 
The simulation also output estimates of variables that describe
the dynamics and the characteristic distances of the merger. The relative
3D velocities of the subclusters, both at the time of the
collision ($v_{3D}(t_{col})$) and at the time of observation
($v_{3D}(t_{obs})$) are provided. The characteristic
distances included in the outputs are the maximum 3D separation ($d_{max}$),
which is the distance between the subclusters at
the apoapsis and the 3D separation of the subclusters at observation
($d_{3D}$). 
\subsection{Design and application of priors} 
\label{sec:priors}
%\input{2.3_prior}
One of the biggest strengths of the Monte Carlo simulation by \citetalias{D13} is its ability
to detect and rule out extreme input values that would result in
unphysical realizations via the application of prior probability. 
Our default priors are described in D13 and we include them in
Appendix~\ref{app:results} for the convenience of the readers. 
In addition, we have devised a new prior on the projection angle $\alpha$
based on the polarization fraction of the radio relic.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Monte Carlo prior based on the polarization fraction of the radio relic}
%\input{2.3_1_polarization_prior}

We can relate the polarization fraction of the radio relic to the
projection angle by examining the
generating mechanism of the radio relic.
The observed radio relic is due to synchrotron emission of free electrons in a
magnetic field. If the magnetic field is uniform, the observed
polarization fraction of the synchrotron emission of the electrons depends on the
viewing angle (or equivalently the projection angle) with respect to the alignment of the magnetic field. 
Synchrotron emission from electrons inside unorganized magnetic field are
randomly polarized. The high reported integrated polarization fraction from
\citet{L13} can be explained by a highly aligned magnetic field,
compressing the ICM during a merger
(\citealt{E98}, \citealt{vanWeeren10}, \citealt{Feretti12}).
This picture is consistent with a high polarization fraction perpendicular
to this magnetic field along the relic. 
\par
We designed our prior to reflect how $\alpha$ decreases monotonically as the
maximum observable integrated polarization fraction. 
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Ensslin_polar_fig.pdf}
	\caption{Predictions of polarization percentage of the radio relic at a
		given projection angle from different models, reproduced from
		\citealt{E98}. Each model assumes electrons producing the radio emission
		to be accelerated inside uniform magnetic field of various strengths ({\it strong} or 
		{\it weak}). The curves are plotted with spectral index of the radio emission
		($\alpha_{radio}$), spectral index of the electrons ($\gamma$) and
		compression ratio of the magnetic field ($R$) corresponding to the
		estimated values from \citet{L13}.
		We highlight the observed polarization percentage of the main NW radio relic
		of El Gordo by the dotted vertical line with the greyed out region
		indicating the uncertainty \citep{L13}.\label{fig:Ensslin_fig}}
\end{figure}
This assumption is based on the class of models given by \cite{E98}(See
Figure~\ref{fig:Ensslin_fig}). In particular, we refer to a model from \cite{E98} 
that would give the most
conservative estimate on the upper bound of $\alpha$:
\begin{align}
\alpha &= 90 \degree -
\arcsin
\left(
\sqrt{
\frac{
	\frac{2}{15} \frac{13R - 7}{R - 1} \frac{\gamma + 7/3}{\gamma + 1}
	\langle P_{strong} \rangle}{
	1 + \frac{\gamma + 7/3}{ \gamma +1} \langle P_{strong} \rangle }}\right),
\end{align}

This model corresponds to the strong field case with the relic being supported by
magnetic pressure only, with the spectral index of the radio
emission being $\alpha_{radio} = 0.86$, the compression ratio of the
magnetic field being
$R=2.7$ and the spectral index of the electrons being $\gamma = 2.7$. 
This model predicts a maximum integrated polarization fraction of
$\sim60\%$ when $\alpha \rightarrow 0$. 
%We consider 39\degree as an upper bound on the projection angle since this 
% idealized model assume isotropic distribution of magnetic field and
%electrons. 
This  polarization fraction of $\sim60\%$ predicted by \citep{E98} is
consistent with the upper bound of relic polarization fraction in cosmological
simulations \citep{S13}. From this model, the
observed integrated polarization fraction of $33\%\pm1\%$ corresponds to an estimated value
of $\hat{\alpha}  = 35\degree$. 
No other model of the magnetic field should predict 
a higher polarization fraction, thus it is highly unlikely that we see 33\%
integrated polarization at $\alpha > 35\degree$.  
\par

We cannot rule out $\alpha \leq 35\degree$ because magnetic field
nonuniformities can lower the polarization below the Ensslin model value.
\cite{E98} assumes an isotropic distribution of electrons in an isotropic magnetic field. Cosmological
simulations of radio relics from \cite{S13} show varying polarization
fraction across and along the relic assuming $\alpha = 0$, resulting in a
lower integrated polarization fraction. For example, it is possible to see 
a edge-on radio relic ($\alpha = 0$) with integrated polarization fraction of 33\%. 
Furthermore, \cite{S13} shows that after convolving the
simulated polarization signal with a Gaussian kernel of 4\arcmin~to
illustrate effects of non-zero beam size, the polarization fraction drops
to between 30\% to 65\% even when $\alpha = 0$. We examined the effects of perturbing
the cutoff value of this prior to ensure the uncertainties do not
introduce significant bias in the estimated output variables in
section~\ref{sec:sensitivityTests}.
To summarize, we adopt a conservative uniform prior to encapsulate the
information from the polarization fraction of the radio relic as:
\begin{equation}
P(\alpha) = 
	\begin{cases}
	& \text{const. $>$ 0 for  }\alpha < 35 \degree \\ 
	& 0 \text{ otherwise}\label{eqn:polarprior}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
We refer to equation \ref{eqn:polarprior} as the polarization prior. Unless
otherwise stated, the main results of the paper are obtained after applying
this polarization prior in addition to the default priors.

\subsection{Extension to the Monte Carlo simulation - Determining merger
scenario with radio relic position by model comparison}

One of the biggest questions involving the merger is whether El Gordo was
observed to be in a returning or outgoing phase. We came up with an
estimation by making use of the observed projected separation of the relic from the
center of mass.
Simulations of cluster mergers such as the work of \citet{Paul2011b},
\citet{VanWeerenRJ2011}, and \citet{Springel2007} showed that, merger shock
fronts that may correspond to the radio relics 1) are generated near the
center of mass of the subclusters close to the time of the first
core-passage, 2) propagate outwards with the shock speed decreasing only slightly.
The propagation speed of the shock wave {\it with respect to the
center-of-mass} is reported to drop between 10\% to
30\% from private communication with Paul S. and $\sim 10\%$ from
\citet{Springel2007}. \par 
To capture the monotonically decreasing trend of the
propagation speed of the the shock fronts with respect to the center of
mass, we expressed the possible shock speeds as a factor of the inferred
collisional speed of the corresponding subcluster in the center of mass
(momentum) frame. 
Then we calculated how far the shock would have propagated for our inferred
$TSC_0$ and $TSC_1$ values. We worked in the center of mass frame where the
shock speed is expected to drop slightly with TSC. 
The projected separation of the shock is approximated as:
\begin{equation}
	%s_{proj} = \langle v_{relic} \rangle (\hat{t}_{obs} - \hat{t}_{col})
	s^j_{proj} \approx \langle v_{relic} \rangle^j (t^j_{obs} - t^j_{col})
	\cos(\alpha^j),
	\label{eq:proj_s_model}
\end{equation}
where the superscript $j$ of any variable denotes that the value of the
variable from the $j-th$ realization of the simulation, and $s_{proj}$ is the estimated projected
separation. We estimated the upper and lower bounds of the time-averaged velocity
$\langle v_{relic} \rangle$ of the shock between
the collision of the subclusters and the observed time as:  
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:NW_speed}
	\langle v_{NW relic} \rangle^j &= \beta~v^j_{3D, NW}(t_{col}) \\
	&= \beta~v^j_{3D}(t_{col}) \frac{m^j_{SE}}{m^j_{SE} + m^j_{NW}}, 
\end{align}
where $0.7 \leq \beta \leq 1.5$ is a factor that we introduce to represent the
uncertainty of the velocity of the relic shockwave, and $v_{3D, NW}(t_{col})$ refers to the collisional velocity of
the NW subcluster in the center-of-mass frame as a comparison. 
Likewise, we have also computed the expected projected separation of the SE
relic using:  
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:SE_speed}
	\langle v_{SE relic} \rangle^j = \beta~v^j_{3D}(t_{col}) \frac{m^j_{NW}}{m^j_{SE} + m^j_{NW}}. 
\end{equation}
\par 
We examined the projected separation for a large range of $0.7 <\beta <
1.5$. This range of $\beta \approx 1$ allows us to use  
equations \ref{eqn:NW_speed} and \ref{eqn:SE_speed} to reflect that the
shock is driven by the merger. We note that the propagation speed of the
shock is also determined by the temperature, density and other details of
the gas medium (\citealt{Prokhorov2007}, \citealt{Springel2007},
\citealt{Milosavljevic07}), so the shock may propagate with $\beta > 1$ without violating any physics
laws. However, we note that merger shocks from cosmological
simulations are reported to show a low Mach number between 1 and 3
\citep{Bruggen2011}, with an even tighter upper limit on the Mach number of
$\sim 1$ reported for mergers of comparable masses \citep{Markevitch2007}.    
Simulation of the Bullet Cluster by \cite{Springel2007} also indicates that the
propagation velocity of the shock evolves such that $\beta \approx 0.95$ within
$\sim 0.4~\giga$yr after the collision. For the analysis of El Gordo,
we suggest $\beta \approx 0.9$ to be the most likely value given that the $TSC$ of
El Gordo is longer. 
\label{sec:positionprior}

\section{RESULTS} 
We found that the two subclusters collided with a relative velocity of $2400\pm^{900}_{400}~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$, at an estimated projection
angle of $\alpha = 21\degree\pm^{9}_{11}$. From our analysis of the two
scenarios, we found that El Gordo is more likely to be observed at a returning
phase with a estimate of $TSC_1 = 0.91\pm^{0.22}_{0.39}$ Gyr. We present an
overview of all the estimated variables in table~\ref{tab:outputs}, with
results only applying the default priors on the left hand side of the table
and those applied with the polarization prior on the right hand side.
Furthermore, we include the plots of all the marginalized PDFs with the
polarization prior in Appendix~\ref{app:results}. \par 
Our estimates of $v_{3D}(t_{col}) = 2400\pm^{900}_{400}~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ 
at the time of collision is compatible with the independent estimate from \citealt{L13}. 
By making use of the Mach number of the NW radio relic, \cite{L13}
reported an estimate of the upper bound of the relative collisional
velocity to be $2500
\pm^{400}_{300}\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. 
From the simulation of the Bullet Cluster, Springel \& Farrar (2007) showed
that pre-shock gas could travel at as high as $\sim
1100~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ from the outer edge of the subclusters to
the merger center.  It is therefore reasonable to assume the reported speed
from \cite{L13} to be an estimate of the {\it relative collisional speed
between the subclusters}, instead of the collision speed of the NW
subcluster {\it relative to the center-of-mass}.
Magnitude of the relative $v_{3D}$ of the subclusters dropped as the
subclusters climbed out of the gravitational potential of each other, and
reduced to $v_{3D}(t_{obs}) = 940~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ at
the time of observation.\par 
The projection angle of the El Gordo is estimated to be
$21\degree \pm^{13}_{17}$. Without the polarization priors, the Monte Carlo
simulation gives the estimate of the projection angle as $43\degree^{26}_{24}$.
Many previous studies (van Weeren et al. CITATIONS) have
suggested that $\alpha$ should be small for the detection of double radio
relics to be possible but did not provide quantitative constraints.    

\subsection{Time-since-collision (TSC) and the merger scenario}
The simulation gives two estimates for
the time-since-collision, with $TSC_0 = 0.46\pm^{0.9}_{0.16}~\giga \text{yr}$
and $TSC_1 =0.91\pm^{0.39}_{0.22}~\giga\text{yr}$. Both the estimates of
$TSC_0$ and $TSC_1$ are compatible physical time-scales of observable
features of El Gordo. Both estimates are lower than the approximate
observable time-scale of the wake feature in the X-ray, i.e.\ the sound
crossing time of $\sim2~\giga$yr. The observable time scale of the radio relics is also on the scale of
$\sim1~\giga$yr.\par 
Based on section~\ref{sec:positionprior}, we present the most likely
value of $\beta = 0.9$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:our_guessed_scenario} to show that
the returning case is preferred for both the calculations of the NW and the
SE relic. This conclusion favoring the returning case holds true for $\beta
< 1.1$, which corresponds to the time-averaged velocity of the relics at
$\langle v_{NW relic} \rangle < 1000~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ and $\langle
v_{SE relic} \rangle < 1800~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ in the center of
mass frame. For comparison purpose, we found that an extreme, and unlikely
range of $\beta > 1.5$ would be needed for the outgoing scenario to be
preferred. (See appendix~\ref{app:Bayes_factor} for plots of all the range
of $\beta$ that we examined). We marginalized $\beta$ to compute a Bayes
factor to compare the ratio between the likelihood of the returning case
and the outgoing case, and obtained a Bayes factor to be $\approx 1.6$ from
the NW relic and a Bayes factor of $\approx 460$ for the SE relic, showing
that our results favor the returning scenario despite the
uncertainties.
(See appendix~\ref{app:Bayes_factor}). Finally, we note that the estimate of NW shock velocity at $2500
\pm^{400}_{300}~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ by \cite{L13} was reported with respect to
the turbulent ICM, not the propogation velocity with respect to center of
mass, so we have not made use of the estimate of \cite{L13} in this
calculation. \par

\subsection{Sensitivity analysis of the polarization prior}
%\input{3.3_sens_analysis}
\label{sec:sensitivityTests}
We performed tests of how each of the output variables vary according to the
choice of the cutoff of the polarization prior between
$\alpha_{\text{cutoff}} =
29 \degree$ to $49\degree$ instead of $35 \degree$.  
We found that in the most extreme case, choosing the cutoff values as $29
\degree$ ($-6 \degree$), the location of the $v_{3D}(t_{obs})$, is
increased by $ 16 \%$. While the $95\%$ CI of $d_{max}$ is
the most sensitive to the prior and it changes by
$\sim20 \%$ when $\alpha_{\text{cutoff}} = 49 \degree$. 
This shows that the exact choice of the cut off value for $\alpha$ for the
polarization prior does not change our estimates drastically.


%Both estimates are consistent with the estimate of $\alpha > 11.6 \degree$ from
%\citet{L13} based on the dynamics of the radio relic.

\section{DISCUSSION}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comparison of our study with other studies of El Gordo}
We outline the qualitative agreement and disagreement between our
simulations and other hydrodynamical simulations of El Gordo such as
\cite{Donnert13} and \cite{Molnar14}. Our simulation focuses on giving PDF
estimates of particular dynamical and kinematic variables, whereas the
hydrodynamical simulations focused on understanding the detailed gas dynamics
required to reproduce the X-ray observables and Sunyaev-Zeldovich
observables of El Gordo. The goals,
assumptions, and initial conditions of \cite{Donnert13} and \cite{Molnar14}
are different from our simulations such that it is hard to come up with a
fair comparison. \par 
Both hydrodynamical simulations were based on a few sets of initial
conditions, instead of a thorough sampling of the inputs. For example, both
simulations made use of the mass estimates of from the dynamics analysis
of \citetalias{M12} at $m_{NW} = 1.9 \times
10^{15} M_{\sun}$,
which is larger than the upper 95\% CI of the mass that we used based on
the weak lensing estimate.
Furthermore, \cite{Molnar14} initialized the relative infall velocity
(velocity when the separation of subclusters equals the sum of the two virial
radii) to be $> 2250~\kilo \meter~ \second^{-1}$. This corresponds to
$v_{3D}(t_{col}) \gtrsim 4700~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$, which is close to
the escape velocity of the subclusters. From our simulation, there is a
negligible number of realizations with $v_{3D}(t_{col}) >
3000~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. The range of projection angles suggested by
\cite{Molnar14} of $\alpha \gtrsim 45\degree$ is also excluded by our
polarization prior, whereas, we are unable to find information concerning
the projection angle of the simulation from \cite{Donnert13}, and we note
that \cite{Donnert13}
might have assumed $\alpha = 0$. \par 
With a time resolution of 0.25 $\giga$yr,
\cite{Donnert13} gave an estimate of  $T\approx 2~\giga$yr between the
first and second core-passage in Fig. 6 of their work, while our estimate gives $T
= 1.4\pm {0.2}~\giga$yr. 
By making use of the simulated X-ray luminosity and the projected separation
of $0.69$ Mpc, \cite{Donnert13} also reported their simulated work 
to best match  observation at $\sim 0.15~\giga$yr after collision. 
The $TSC_0$ from \cite{Donnert13} is below the estimated 95\% CI of
$TSC_0$ from our work and this might be due to their assumption of a zero
projection angle, it would take subclusters in our simulation with a
non-zero projection angle a longer time to travel the same projected distance. 
On the other hand, \cite{Donnert13} obtained a
relative collisional velocity between the subclusters at $\sim
2600~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$, which is compatible with our estimate of
$2400^{400}_{200}~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$.  
This agreement might be due to the similar assumptions of a low
energy orbit and a small impact parameter as the initial conditions in the
work of \cite{Donnert13} and our work.  


\subsection{Comparison to the merger scenarios of other merging clusters of galaxies}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{merger_scenario.pdf}
	\caption{Illustration of the different merger scenarios, i.e. projected displacement
		($s_{proj}$) from the center of mass of different components, of El
		Gordo and the Bullet Cluster, at different stage of the merger.  
		Shortly after the core-passage
		phase of the merger, the cool core had to travel through a dense gas region.
		Ram pressure would strip the gas component from a subcluster and cause the
		cool core to lag behind the DM peak (This corresponds to the scenario
		for the Bullet Cluster). As time went by, the DM and the cool core of
		a subcluster would propagate outwards while slowing down, they would
		encounter a region with much lower gas density. At this later stage
		, the ram pressure from the lower density gas in the
		outskirt region would decrease drastically so the cool core would not be slowed
		down as much, as if it had received a kick in a slingshot. During this
		later stage, the DM component would have also reached the
		apoapsis and started returning to the center of mass for a second
		core-passage. The cool core would then be able to travel further away from
		the center of mass than the DM component. (El Gordo scenario)
	\label{fig:merger_scenario}}
\end{figure}
The hypothesis of El Gordo being in the outbound phase is more plausible when
we compare the details of the observables of El Gordo to the Bullet
Cluster (\citealt{Bradac2006b}, \citealt{Springel2007},
\citealt{Mastropietro2008a}).
A lot of the inferred properties are similar between the two clusters and
both clusters were observed in similar wavelengths. Both clusters are
considered bimodal major mergers of subclusters of significant masses. The inferred
merger velocities are comparable at around $2600~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$
and $\alpha$ of both clusters are around $20 \degree$. 
In particular, the inferred outbound $TSC_0 / T$ of the Bullet Cluster and El Gordo
are similar. If instead, the El Gordo
is in the outbound phase of the merger (i.e. $TSC_0$ for El Gordo is
invalid) while the Bullet Cluster is in the inbound phase, the differences
in the observables of El Gordo and the Bullet Cluster can be explained.\par
First, the merger shock front of the Bullet Cluster is
observed only in the X-ray, meaning that the shock has not had the
time to propagate to the outskirt of the cluster (\citealt{Bruggen2011},
\citealt{Markevitch2007}), and this bow shock is indeed observed to closely
lead the corresponding less massive subcluster by $\sim 0.08~\mega$pc,
assuming they are propagating outwards. On the other hand, indirect observables of the merger
shocks of El Gordo can only be detected through the radio relic, and the shock is
further offset from the corresponding subcluster ($\sim 0.5~\mega$pc) and
the cool core ($\sim 0.4~\mega$pc). \par
%(Should discuss the Mach number,
%the speed of sounds in each cluster, and the DM velocities)  
Second, for the Bullet Cluster, the cool core (or the bullet) is closer to the
interior of the cluster than the corresponding less massive DM subcluster mass
peak, whereas, the cool core of El Gordo is further offset from the center of
mass than the corresponding SE subcluster (See Fig.~\ref{fig:config} for
the observed positions). 
Both configurations of cool core relative to the subcluster mass peak are
mentioned in \cite{Markevitch2007}, with the case of the Bullet Cluster
explained by the ram pressure stripping effect, and the case of El Gordo
explained by the ram pressure slingshot effect, which only occurs at a
later stage of a merger. (See Fig. \ref{fig:merger_scenario} for an
illustration depicting this conjectured scenario)\par 
Simulation of a major merger by
\cite{Mathis05} with similar mass and mass ratio as El Gordo confirms this
picture: it shows the turn-around of the cool core can occur after the
apoapsis of the DM component, resulting in the cool core being further
away from the center of mass than the dark matter by as much as $\sim
0.2~\mega$pc.  The cool core of El Gordo shows a comet-like
morphology that suggests an outbound motion of the cool core, however, from
the above argument, we cannot rule out the possibility that the DM
subclusters had already started returning for a second core-passage. 
If the returning scenario is true, El Gordo would be one of the first
clusters to be observed at a late stage of the merger, after another
bimodal cluster merger A168 with a cool front leading the corresponding DM
subcluster \citep{Hallman04}.

\subsection{El Gordo as a probe of dark matter self-interaction}

% cite Markevitch paper about the self-interacting cross section

% spatial separation of gas-DM not really great for constraining sigma
% 

Time variability of the gas-DM offset makes it not a very suitable probe

galaxy-DM offset remain to investigate how galaxy propagates 

the Musketball Cluster (\citealt{Dawson12}, \citetalias{D13}). 

%In addition to the default prior, \citetalias{D13} applied a temporal prior
%based on the observed X-ray luminosity boost for the Bullet Cluster, while
%only the default priors were suitable to be applied for the Musketball.
%Therefore, with the additional priors, both the Bullet Cluster and El Gordo
%show a more constrained parameter space.
%\begin{equation}
%	\text{scattering rate}\propto v 
%\end{equation}

The three output variables that we compare among the listed clusters include $TSC$,
$v_{3D}$ and the masses. These variables can affect
how strongly the self-interaction of dark matter would manifest itself in
case the DM self-interaction cross section is not zero. A higher TSC might
allow more time for DM to interact with itself; a higher $v_{3D}$ might
 and a higher mass would correspond to
higher central density for a higher self-interaction rate. Although El
Gordo is the most massive among the listed clusters, the higher mass did not result in a higher $v_{3D}(t_{col})$.
The estimate of $v_{3D}(t_{col}) = 2400~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ is
comparable to the inferred $v_{3D}(t_{col}) =
2800~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ of the Bullet Cluster. 
Both the phase $TSC_0  \approx 40\%~T$ and the $TSC_0 = 0.6~\giga$yr are
similar between El Gordo and the Bullet Cluster
It is remained to be investigated if our hypothesis about the relationship
between how these variables would affect our chance of seeing effects from
self-interaction of dark matter. 


Merging clusters of galaxies are unique probes of the self-interaction of
dark matter from the separation of different components. In particular, it
is interesting to examine the scattering probability of dark matter by other dark matter. 
From \cite{Randall2008d}, the scattering probability of each dark matter
would be proportional to the local dark matter density and the relative
velocities. 


El Gordo is one of the most massive merging galaxy clusters. 

This is further complicated by the likely returning scenario of El Gordo.

\subsection{Limitations of our data analysis and future work} 
We note that our method of inferring the 3D velocities by deprojecting the
radial velocities might not be optimal but is commonly used (\citetalias{M12},
\citealt{Dawson12}). The relative
radial velocities are dependent on the identification of subcluster members.
However, it is unclear that a spatial
cut according to number density peaks would be optimal for selecting
galaxies that represent the underlying velocities of the subclusters. Traditionally, grouping members
may be treated as a (statistical) clustering problem with well known
methods such as normal mixture model. However, our setting is complicated
by the fact that each of the observed redshifts of galaxies is an unknown
combination of cosmological redshift and redshift due to peculiar motion
along the line-of-sight. Our study only made use of a limited number of
galaxies with spectroscopy information. This could cause selection bias and
incompleteness due to limitations of the of spectroscopic targets. Existing
literature and tests mostly focus on detecting substructures in galaxy
clusters through non-Gaussianity of the velocity dispersion
(\citealt{Dressler88}, \citealt{Einasto12}). Few extensive studies have focused on finding out the uncertainties
associated with this clustering procedure for inferring the dynamics of
merging clusters. This problem of inferring galaxies to best reflect
subcluster dynamics presents an interesting direction for investigation in the future.   
 
Despite the limitations and simplifying assumptions, this work provides
insight to the merger dynamics and configuration of El Gordo as a basis for further studies.
Tests for signs of self-interaction of DM in El Gordo can be done
by comparing the offset between the member galaxies and the
DM distribution of the subclusters. By understanding the merging scenario,
we can infer if the observed galaxy-DM offset are in the expected
direction such that the collisionless galaxies lead the DM subhalos along
the direction of motion. \par 
In addition, our work has allowed us to examine
what information would be needed to better understanding of the merger
dynamics and scenario. Important questions concerning the radio
relic and the merger pending for answers include:  
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the typical propagation velocities of the shockwave that
corresponds to the radio relic in the	center of mass frame of the cluster?
\item What physical properties of the DM subclusters would correlate the
	best with the time-evolution of the propagation velocity of the shockwave?  
\item What is the typical duration
after the merger for which radio relics are observable in terms of the merger
core-passage time-scales? 
\end{itemize}
We urge simulators working on radio relic
simulations to help come up with answers that would be directly
comparable with data. \par 

As a summary, this paper presents one of the first examples of using the
observed radio relic emission to constrain cluster merger properties, the
results
\begin{enumerate}
	\item demonstrate the first use of polarization fraction information from
		the radio relics to constrain the projection angle to $21 \degree
		\pm^{9}_{11}$ (See	Fig. \ref{fig:geom_geom})\\ 
	\item 
		shows a {\it relative} collisional velocity between the subclusters of El
		Gordo as $2400~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ \\ 
	\item favors a returning scenario if the $\langle v_{NW relic}\rangle \leq
		1000~\kilo
		\meter~\second^{-1}$ and $\langle v_{SE relic}\rangle \leq
		1800~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$between the collision and the observation in the
		center-of-mass frame. It takes
		an unlikely high speed of $\langle v_{relic} \rangle \gg 1.5~v_{3D,
		sub}(t_{col})$ for the outgoing scenario to be favored.  
	\item is a prime example of a cluster merger at a later stage  
\end{enumerate}

\section{DEFAULT PRIORS USED FOR DAWSON'S MONTE CARLO SIMULATION}
\label{app:priors}
%\input{app_a_MCMAC_stat_formalism}
The default prior probabilities that we employed can be summarized as
follows for most of the output variables: 

\begin{equation}
	P(v_{3D}(t_{col}) | \alpha, v_{proj}(t_{col})) = 0\text{ if }v_{3D}(t_{col}) >
	v_{\text{free fall}}. 
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
	P(TSC_0) = 
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if }TSC_0 < \text{age of universe at } z=0.87	\\
		& 0~\text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

In addition, we apply the following prior on $TSC_1$ only when evaluating the
statistics of $TSC_1$, thus allowing realiziations with a valid
outgoing TSC but an invalid returning $TSC_1$. 

\begin{equation}
	P(TSC_1) = 
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if }TSC_1 < \text{age of universe at } z=0.87	\\
		& 0~\text{otherwise} \label{eqn:TSM_1}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

To correct for observational limitations, we further convolve the
posterior probabilities of the different realizations with 
\begin{equation}
	P(TSC_0 | T) = 2 \frac{TSC_0}{T},
\end{equation}
to account for how the subclusters move faster at lower $TSC$ and thus it
is more probable to observe the subclusters at a stage with a larger $TSC$.

\section{Model comparison for the outgoing and returning scenario}

		includes 95\% confidence interval of location of relic in the center of

	For the most likely value of $\beta < 1.1$, the returning scenario is preferred. 
	For comparison purpose, we also show that the shock velocity has to
	be as extreme as $1.5~v_{3D, NW}(t_{col})$ (top panel) for the outgoing
	scenario to be favored. 
	Note that we made use of the	polarization prior for producing this figure. 
	\label{fig: positionprior}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{polar_prior_bounds_SE.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of the PDFs of the observed position of the SE relic (red bar
		includes 95\% confidence interval of location of relic in the center of
		mass frame) with the	predicted position from the two simulated merger scenarios (blue for
	outgoing and green for the returning scenario). 
	For the most likely value of $\beta < 1.1$, the returning scenario is preferred. 
	We obtained similar conclusion about the merger scenario as for the NW
	relic calculation.
	\label{fig:positionprior_SE}}
\end{figure}
We can write down our model for the different scenarios to be $M_{out}$ and
$M_{ret}$ for the outgoing and returning scenarios respectively. Both
models are computed using the same variables except for $TSC$. The models
are parametrized by $\beta$, which represents our uncertainty of $\langle v_{relic} \rangle$
(See equation~\ref{eq:proj_s_model}). Our data in this
case is the observed projected location of the radio relic $s_{proj}$. 
The Bayes factor thus can be computed as: 
\begin{align}
	K &= \frac{P(s_{proj} | M_{ret})}{P(s_{proj}| M_{out}}\\
	 &= \frac
	 {\int P(\beta | M_{ret}) P(s_{proj} | \beta, M_{ret}) d\beta}
	 {\int P(\beta | M_{out}) P(s_{proj} | \beta, M_{out})
 d\beta}\\
 &\approx 
 \begin{cases}
 & 1.6 \text{ for the NW relic}\\
 & 460 \text{ for the SE relic}
 \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $P(s_{proj} | \beta, M_{ret})$ and $P(s_{proj} | \beta, M_{out})$ can be
viewed as the green and blue curves respectively for each given $\beta$ value and we
have used priors on $\beta$ as: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:beta_prior}
	P(\beta | M_{ret}) = P(\beta | M_{out}) =  
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if } 0.7 \leq \beta \leq 1.5 \\
		& 0~\text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
This conservative prior is chosen to reflect our belief that the
NW shockfront should propagate at approximately $v_{3D, NW}(t_{col})$ in the
center-of-mass frame, and likewise for the SE shockfront, although we do
not think that $\beta_{SE} = \beta_{NW}$ has to be necessarily true. 
%When we assume $\langle v_{relic} \rangle / v_{3D, 1}(t_{col}) = 1.5$ (uppermost
%panel of Figure \ref{fig: positionprior}), $\langle v_{relic} \rangle$
%corresponds to an time-averaged velocity of $\sim3800~\kilo
%\meter~\second^{-1}$ relative to SE subcluster, or, in the center of
%mass frame $\sim1400~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. 
As more
simulations of merger shocks become available, one can update equation~\ref{eq:beta_prior} accordingly.
