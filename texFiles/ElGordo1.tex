\section{Introduction} 
\input{1_intro}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{DATA} 
In this paper we made use of data from multiple sources for different
purposes. For assigning membership of galaxies to the two identified subclusters, we
examined the spectroscopic data obtained from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and
Germini South as described in \citetalias{M12} and \citet{Sifon13}.
For the weak-lensing mass estimation, we used the published
Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) mass estimates from \citetalias{Jee13}.
See Table~\ref{tab:inputs} for descriptions of the probability density
functions (PDFs) of the input
variables. \par 
%and these galaxies were discussed as the population in Region A in
%\citetalias{Jee13}.  
In order to constrain our parameter space, we referred to the properties of
the radio relic from \citet{L13}. El Gordo shows radio relics on the
periphery of both subclusters \citepalias{M12}. Two radio relics, the
northwest (NW) relic and the southeast (SE) relic, of El Gordo were first
discovered in the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) data in low
resolution at 843 MHz \citep{Mauch03} as shown in M12. The higher
resolution radio observation conducted by \cite{L13} at 610 \mega Hz and
2.1 \giga Hz confirms that the identity of the NW radio relic
after removing effects of radio point sources.The NW radio relic, which
possesses the most extended geometry (Mpc in length)
among all radio source, was identified to be associated with the
merger. We do not refer to the SUMSS SE radio relic in this paper since the
SE radio relic is reported to be caused by a compact radio source \citep{L13}.

\section{METHOD -- Monte Carlo simulation} 
%\input{2.0_montecarlo_framework}
To explore the multidimensional and highly-correlated input parameter space
with large uncertainties, we used the collisionless 
dark-matter-only Monte Carlo modeling code written by Dawson (2013),
hereafter \citepalias{D13}. 




In the D13 code, the time evolution of the
head-on merger was computed based on an analytical model assuming that the
only dominant force is the gravitational attraction from the masses of two
truncated Naverro-Frenk-White (hereafter NFW) DM halos. 
Under the assumption of conservation of energy, the Monte Carlo simulation
excludes all realizations that would result in relative collisional
velocities) of the subclusters higher than the free-fall velocity ($\sim
4500~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. This also implies that only
gravitationally bound mergers are included in the simulation.
Other major assumptions for modeling systems with this code include
negligible impact parameter (cite M11???) and negligible self-interaction
of dark matter and negligible mass accretion during the merger. 
\par

In the Monte Carlo simulation, many realizations of the collision is
computed from the inputs of each realization, including
the data ($\vec{D}$) and the model variable ($\alpha$). In particular,
the standard required data, which were in the form of samples of the
probability density functions (PDFs), included the masses ($M_{200_{NW}},M_{200_{SE}}$) the
redshifts ($z_{NW}, z_{SE}$) and the projected separation of the two
subclusters ($d_{proj}$).  
%For the $j-$th realization, w
In each realization, we randomly drew samples of the PDFs.
These inputs are then used for computing the output variables
($\vec{\theta}^\prime$) by making use of conservation of energy to describe
their collision due to the mutual gravitational attraction.
(See Table~\ref{tab:inputs}
for quantitative descriptions of the sample PDFs and we outline how those
PDFs are obtained in the following subsections.) 
To ensure convergence of the output PDFs, in total, 2 million realizations were computed. 
The results, however, are consistent up to a fraction of a percent just from 20 000 runs
\citepalias{D13}.\par    
We adapt a Bayesian interpretation of the outputs of the Monte Carlo
simulation. The Bayes chain rule underlies the simulation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    P(M|\vec{D}) \propto P(\vec{D}|M)P(M)
\end{equation}
where the likelihood is defined to be the PDF of $\vec{D}$ given our
physical model $M$ which we parametrize using variables in Table 1
($\vec{\theta}$) by
assuming conservation of energy, which is
represented by a suitable functional form $f$ below. For example,the
calculation of the output variables of the $j$-th realization can be denoted as: 
\begin{equation}
    (\vec{\theta}^\prime)^{(j)} = f(\vec{\theta}^{(j)}, \vec{D}) 
\end{equation}    
and computed over all $j$ realizations. Finally, we took the physical
constraints on the dynamical variables into account by
examining the resulting physical variables against the physical limits and
excluding realizations that would produce impossible values. We refer to this
process of excluding unphysical realizations as applying priors. 
Even though we denote the priors for one dimension at a time (See Appendix~\ref{app:priors}), 
the correlations between different variables are properly taken into account
 due to how we throw away all the variables of problematic
realizations. 

\subsection{Inputs of the Monte Carlo simulation} \label{sec: inputs}
\setcounter{table}{0} 
\input{input_table}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Membership selection and redshift estimation of subclusters}
%\input{2.1_1_membership_redshift}
We adopt the identification of galaxy membership of El Gordo given by
\citetalias{M12} with a total count of 89 galaxies.
%The overall membership of the galaxies
%of El Gordo was first determined using a shifting gapper method
%\citep{Fadda96} after applying a rest frame cut of
%4000~\kilo\meter~\second$^{-1}$ \citep{Sifon13}. This method gives a
To further distinguish member galaxies of each subcluster, we adopt a
redshift cut of $z < 0.886$, and a spatial cut along (01:03:22.0,
-49:12:32.9) and (01:02:35.1, -49:18:09.8). The spatial cut is approximately perpendicular
to the 2D merger axis and are consistent with the bimodal number density
contours (See Figure~\ref{fig:membership}). We determined that
there are 51 members in the NW subclusters and 35 members in the SE
subclusters. 
The spatial cut indicated by the black line was done after
mapping the world coordinates to pixel coordinates to avoid anamorphic
distortion.  

%Compare and contrast the amount of bootstrapping and the reported
%redshifts and velocity dispersion.
After identifying members of each subcluster, we performed 10, 000 bootstrap realizations to estimate the biweight
locations of the spectroscopic redshifts of the respective members in order
to obtain the
samples of the PDFs of the redshifts of each subcluster. 
The spectroscopic redshift of the subclusters were
determined to be 
%$z_{total} = \pm $ 
$z_{\mathrm{NW}} = 0.86842 \pm 0.0011$ and 
$z_{\mathrm{SE}} = 0.87131 \pm 0.0012$, where the quoted numbers represent the
biweight location and 1$\sigma$ bias-corrected confidence level
respectively \citep{Beers90}.  
Both the estimated redshifts of the subclusters and the uncertainties are
consistent with estimates of $z=0.8701 \pm 0.0009$ for El Gordo given by \citealt{Sifon13}, and the fact that the
member galaxies of El
Gordo shows large velocity dispersion and has the largest velocity
dispersion among all the ACT galaxy clusters as reported by
\citetalias{M12}.

We estimated the radial velocity differences of the
subclusters by first calculating the velocity of each subcluster with
respective to us, using  
\begin{equation}
	v_i = \left[ \frac{(1+z_i)^2 - 1 }{(1+z_i)^2 + 1 }\right]c
\end{equation}
where $i=1, 2$ represents the two subclusters, and $c$ is the speed of
light. The radial velocity was calculated by: 
\begin{equation}
	\Delta v_{rad}(t_{obs}) = \frac{|v_2 - v_1|}{1-\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\end{equation}
Due to the estimates of the subcluster redshifts are close to
one another with overlapping confidence intervals, we obtained a low 
radial velocity difference of the two subclusters to be
$476~\pm~242~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. 
The quoted radial velocity differences of $586~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$ reported by \citetalias{M12} 
is higher than our estimates but within the 68\% bias-corrected
confidence interval. 
%The estimate from the approximation of $\Delta v_{rad}
%= c(z_1 - z_2) / (1 + z_1)$ in the frame of the NW subcluster.

	member galaxies and the division of the member galaxies among the two subclusters of El Gordo by a spatial cut

redshift of the member galaxies (see color bar for matching of
spectroscopic values), with the redder end indicating higher
redshift. The background number density contours in green indicate a bimodal
distribution.} 
\end{figure}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Weak lensing mass estimation} 
%\input{2.1_2_WL}
We obtained 40, 000 samples of the joint PDFs of the mass of the two dark
matter halos as the outputs of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
procedure from \citealt{Jee13}. Discussion of the handling of the weak
lensing source galaxies and the details the MCMC procedure for mass
estimation can be found in \citealt{Jee13}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Estimation of projected separation ($d_{proj}$)} 
To be consistent with our MCMC mass inference, our Monte Carlo simulation takes 
the projected separation of the NFW halos to be those of the inferred
DM centroid locations in \citealt{Jee13}. We draw random samples
 of the location of centroids from two 2D Gaussians centered at
 RA=01:02:50.601, Decl.=-49:15:04.48 for the NW subcluster and RA =
 01:02:56.312, Decl. = -49:16:23.15 for the SE
subcluster, with a 1'' standard deviation each. Or equivalently, the
samples of the inferred centroid locations correspond to a projected separation of
$0.74\pm {0.007}$ Mpc. 
%A iterative centroiding method is used to find the centers of the two
%subclusters of El Gordo.

\subsection{Outputs of the Monte Carlo simulation}\label{sec: outputs}
%\input{2.2_0_monte_carlo_outputs}

We outline the outputs of the simulation here to facilitate the discussion
of the design of the priors used in the simulation. The simulation
provides PDF estimates for 10 output variables. Variables
of the most interest include the time dependence and the angle $\alpha$, which is
defined to be the projection angle between the plane of the sky and the merger axis. Other output variables are dependent on $\alpha$ and the time
dependence. Specifically, the simulation denotes the time dependence by
providing several characteristic time-scales, including the time
elapsed between consecutive collisions
($T$) and the time-since-collision of the observed state (TSC).  

We provide two versions of the time-since-collision variables $TSC_0$ and
$TSC_1$ to denote different possible merger scenarios. 1) We call the scenario for which the subclusters are
moving apart after collision to be ``outgoing" and it corresponds to the
smaller $TSC_0$ value, and 2) we call the alternative scenario 
``returning" for which the subclusters are approaching each other after turning
around from the apoapsis for the first time and it corresponds to $TSC_1$.
We describe how we make use of properties of the radio relic to evalute
which scenario is more likely in
section~\ref{sec: positionprior}. 
 
The simulation also output estimates of variables that describe
the dynamics and the characteristic distances of the merger. The relative
3D velocities of the subclusters, both at the time of the
collision ($v_{3D}(t_{col})$) and at the time of observation
($v_{3D}(t_{obs})$) are provided. The characteristic
distances included in the outputs are the maximum 3D separation ($d_{max}$),
which is the distance between the position of collision to
the apoapsis; the projected separation $d_{proj}$ and the 3D separation of the subclusters at observation. 
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Design and application of priors} 
\label{sec:priors}
%\input{2.3_prior}
One of the biggest strengths of the Monte Carlo simulation by \citetalias{D13} is its ability
to detect and rule out extreme input values that would result in
unphysical realizations via the application of prior probability. 
Our default priors are described in D13 and we include them in Appendix~\ref{app: results} for the convenience of the readers. 
In addition, we have come up with a prior on the projection angle $\alpha$
based on the polarization fraction of the radio relic.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Monte Carlo priors based on the polarization fraction of the radio relic}
%\input{2.3_1_polarization_prior}

We can relate the polarization fraction of the radio relic to the
projection angle by examining the
generating mechanism of the radio relic.
The observed radio relic is due to synchrotron emission of free electrons in a
magnetic field. If the magnetic field is uniform, the observed
polarization fraction of the synchrotron emission of the electrons depends on the
viewing angle (or equivalently the projection angle) with respect to the alignment of the magnetic field. 
Synchrotron emission from electrons inside unorganized magnetic field are
randomly polarized. The high reported integrated polarization fraction from
\citet{L13} can be explained by a highly aligned magnetic field,
created by the compressed intracluster medium during a merger
(\citealt{E98}, \citealt{vanWeeren10}, \citealt{Feretti12}).
This picture is consistent with a high polarization fraction perpendicular
to this magnetic field along the relic. 
\par
We designed our prior to reflect how $\alpha$ decreases monotonically as the
maximum observable integrated polarization fraction. 
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Ensslin_polar_fig.pdf}
	\caption{Predictions of polarization percentage of the radio relic at a
		given projection angle from different models, reproduced from
		\citealt{E98}. Each model assumes electrons producing the radio emission
		to be accelerated inside uniform magnetic field of various strengths ({\it strong} or {\it weak}). The curves are plotted with spectral index of the radio emission
		($\alpha_{radio}$), spectral index of the electrons ($\gamma$) and
		compression ratio of the magnetic field ($R$) corresponding to the
		estimated values from \citet{L13}.
		We highlight the observed polarization percentage of the main NW radio relic
		of El Gordo by the dotted vertical line with the greyed out region
		indicating the uncertainty \citep{L13}.\label{fig:Ensslin_fig}}
\end{figure}
This assumption is based on the class of models given by \cite{E98}(See
Figure~\ref{fig:Ensslin_fig}). In particular, we refer to a model from \cite{E98} that would give the most
conservative estimate on the upper bound of $\alpha$:
\begin{align}
\alpha &= 90 \degree -
\arcsin
\left(
\sqrt{
\frac{
	\frac{2}{15} \frac{13R - 7}{R - 1} \frac{\gamma + 7/3}{\gamma + 1}
	\langle P_{strong} \rangle}{
	1 + \frac{\gamma + 7/3}{ \gamma +1} \langle P_{strong} \rangle }}\right)
\end{align}

This model corresponds to the strong field case with the relic being supported by
magnetic pressure only, with $\alpha_{radio} = 0.86$, compression ratio
$R=2.7$ and $\gamma = 2.7$. 
This model predicts a maximum integrated polarization fraction of
$\sim60\%$ when $\alpha \rightarrow 0$. From this model, the observed integrated
polarization fraction of $33\%\pm1\%$ corresponds to an estimated value
of $\hat{\alpha}
 = 35\degree$. 
%We consider 39\degree as an upper bound on the projection angle since this idealized model assume isotropic distribution of magnetic field and
%electrons. 
This  polarization fraction of $\sim 60\%$ predicted by \citep{E98} is
consistent with the upper bound of relic polarization fraction in cosmological
simulations \citep{S13}. No other model of the magnetic field should predict a higher polarization fraction, thus it is highly unlikely that we see 33\%
integrated polarization at $\alpha > 35\degree$.  
\par

We cannot rule out $\alpha \leq 35\degree$ as a result of possible
variations in the magnetic field. 
\cite{E98} assumes an isotropic distribution of electrons in an isotropic magnetic field. Cosmological
simulations of radio relics from \cite{S13} show varying polarization
fraction across and along the relic assuming $\alpha = 0$, resulting in a
lower integrated polarization fraction. For example, it is possible to see a edge-on radio relic ($\alpha = 0$) with integrated polarization fraction of 33\%. 
Furthermore, \cite{S13} shows that after convolving the
simulated polarization signal with a Gaussian kernel of 4\arcmin~to
illustrate effects of non-zero beam size, the polarization fraction drops to between 30\% to
65\% even when $\alpha = 0$. 
Other uncertainties come from the fact that the inferred spectral indices
differ between the two observed frequencies and vary between the three
identified relic sources \citep{L13}. We examine the effects  of changing
the cutoff value of this prior to ensure the uncertainties do not
introduce significant bias in the estimated output variables and we
present the results in Appendix \ref{app: results}.
To summarize, we adopt a conservative uniform prior to encapsulate the
information from the polarization fraction of the radio relic as:
\begin{equation}
P(\alpha) = 
	\begin{cases}
	& \text{const. $>$ 0 for  }\alpha < 35 \degree \\ 
	& 0 \text{ otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Extension to the Monte Carlo simulation - Determining merger scenario with radio relic position}
%\begin{figure} 
%	\includegraphics[width =\linewidth]{shock_evolution.pdf}
%	\caption{The simplified view of time evolution of the speeds of the
%	different cluster components during the collision. }
%\end{figure}
\label{sec: positionprior}
%\input{2.4_positionprior}

One of the biggest question involving the merger is if El Gordo was
observed to be in a returning or outgoing phase.
We perform a qualitative comparison of the observed and the
simulated position of the NW radio relic in each scenario.
%This method depends on the time evolution of the relic velocity, which gives the upper and lower bounds on the possible position of the relic for each scenario. 
%%The velocity depends on a number of physical quantities, including the
%local gravitational potential, matter density, temperature, pressure among
%others (\citealt{E98}, Shu .F., more citations?).  The exact time evolution
%of the shock velocity requires detailed numerical simulation similar to
%\citet{Springel2007}, \citet{Vazza11}, \citet{Kang2007}, etc.  
We considered different possibilities of the time evolution of the shock
velocity due to lack of knowledge of the details of the evolution. We drew physical insight from the simulations of the merger shock of the
staged numerical simulation of the Bullet cluster from \citet{Springel2007}
and the cosmological simulation from \citet{Paul2011b}. Right after
the collision of the subclusters, \citet{Springel2007} shows that the shock speed is
comparable to the merger speed of the two subclusters; the shock speed
dropped only by $\sim 14\%$ in the $300~\mega$yr period while the speed of
the main subcluster in the simulation dropped by $\sim65\%$ in the center
of mass frame. On the other hand, \citet{Paul2011b} showed that the shock
speed was $\sim1.5$ times the relative collisional speed of the subcluster
shortly after the collision and the shock speed decreases only
slightly as it propagates away from the center of mass. \par  
We approximated the upper and lower bounds of the NW relic speed with the
simulated speeds of the NW subcluster.  We worked in the center of mass frame where the shock speed is expected to
drop slightly with time. 
The projected separation of the shock is approximated as:
\begin{equation}
	s_{proj} = \langle v_{relic} \rangle (\hat{t}_{obs} - \hat{t}_{col}) \cos(\hat{\alpha})
	\label{eqn: projectedsep}
\end{equation}
where the quantities with hats on the right hand side of the equations were
inferred from the simulation, and $s_{proj}$ is the estimated projected separation and we estimated the
upper and lower bounds of the time-averaged velocity
$\langle v_{relic} \rangle$ of the shock between
the collision of the subclusters and the observed time as:  
\begin{equation}
	\langle v_{relic} \rangle = \beta~v_{3D,1}(t_{col})  
\end{equation}
where $0.5 \leq \beta \leq 1.5$ is a factor that we introduce to represent the
uncertainty of the velocity of the relic shockwave and $v_{3D,1}(t_{col})$ refers to the collisional velocity of
the NW relic in the center-of-mass frame. The upper bound can be
approximated as the collisional speed of the NW subclusters due to how the
shock is powered by the collision. After the collision, it is unlikely that
there would be significant energy injected into the shock to speed up the
shock such that the shock travels much faster than the collision speed of the subcluster. While the shock does not experience gravitational deceleration as a
pressure wave, some dissipative processes may have slowed down the shock
wave slightly as it propagated. By making use of a
range of $\beta$ values, we examine how the rate of slow down would
give a different lower bound of the projected separation of the relic.   
\par

%\subsection{Relative merger speed}
%\input{3_overview}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\input{output_table}
\section{RESULTS} 
We found that the two subclusters collided at with a relative velocity of 
$2400\pm^{900}_{400}~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$, at an estimated projection
angle of $\alpha = 21\degree~\pm^{9}_{11}$. From our analysis of the two
scenarios, we found that El Gordo is more likely to be observed at a returning
phase with a estimate of $TSC_1 = 0.91\pm^{0.22}_{0.39}$ Gyr. We present an
overview of all the estimated variables in table~\ref{tab:outputs}, with
results only applying the default priors on the left hand side of the table
and those applied with the polarization prior on the right hand side.
Furthermore, we include the plots of all the marginalized PDFs with the
polarization prior in Appendix~\ref{app: results}.  

	We estimated the relative merger speed of the two subclusters to be
$2400\pm^{900}_{400}~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$ at the time of collision. 
By making use of the upstream velocity of the shockwave, \cite{L13}
inferred the upper bound of the relative collisional velocity from the Mach
number of the NW radio relic, giving an estimate of $2500
\pm^{400}_{300}\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$.  This speed is compatible with our
simulated collisional speed within the uncertainties. 
However, we note that
the conversion of the frame of reference is non-trivial since the speed is
measured with respect to the turbulent intracluster gas as a Mach number.




%On the other hand, Molnar and Broadhurst found an infall velocity of $2250
%~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$ matching the
%morphology of the X-ray wake feature.
%Based on the observed peculiar velocity difference between
%the galaxies of the two subclusters, 
%$v_{3D}(t_{col}) \approx v_{pec}(t_{obs}) / \sin(\alpha) $, \citetalias{M12} gave two estimates:
%
%\begin{equation}
%v_{3D}(t_{col})  =  586 / \sin(\alpha) ~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}=
%\begin{cases} 
%2300~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}, ~\alpha = 15 \degree \\ 
%1200~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}, ~\alpha = 30 \degree
%\end{cases}
%\label{eqn: M12estimate}
%\end{equation}
%If we use our estimate of $\alpha = 21 \degree$ in
%(\ref{eqn: M12estimate}), we obtain an estimate of $v_{3D}(t_{obs})
%\approx 940~\kilo \meter~ \second^{-1}$ instead. This is consistent with our simulation.  
%
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Time-since-collision}  
%\input{3.1_TSC}

Comparison of the estimate of the location of the radio relic in the
outgoing and returning scenario favors the returning scenario.
The simulation gives two estimates for
the time-since-collision, with $TSC_0 = 0.46~\giga \text{yr}$ and $TSC_1 =
0.91~\giga \text{yr}$. Based on section \ref{sec: positionprior}, we
present estimates for the position of the NW radio relic based on the two PDFs
of inferred TSC as shown in Fig. \ref{fig: positionprior}. We plotted
the PDF of the simulated positions of the relic for the outgoing scenario
(blue) and the returning scenario (green) against
the observed position of the relic (light red), with the width of the
relic accounting for the uncertainty due to the location of the center of
mass, this uncertainty is greater than the width of the relic ($\sim$$23$
kpc) along merger axis \citep{L13}. When we
assume $\langle v_{relic} \rangle / v_{3D,1}(t_{col}) = 1.5$ (uppermost
panel of Figure \ref{fig: positionprior}), $\langle v_{relic} \rangle$
corresponds to a distribution of time-averaged relative velocity with a
location of $\sim 3800~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$ or, in the center of
mass frame $\sim 1400~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$, the outgoing scenario is more favored. As we examine a decreased ratio of  $\langle v_{relic} \rangle /
v_{3D,1}(t_{col})$, we probe how much the shock could have slowed down
and still be consistent with the outgoing scenario. The second (relative
velocity of $2800~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$) and third row of
Fig. \ref{fig: positionprior} show that if $\langle v_{relic} \rangle
\lesssim 1.1 $, the returning scenario would be favored instead.
If the estimates of \citet{L13} of the shock velocity corresponds to $2500 \pm
^{400}_{300} \kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$. 

Both the estimates of the returning and the outgoing scenario are
compatible with the sound crossing time of $\sim 1 Gyr$.  
Hydrodynamical simulations from Donnert et al. and Molnar and Broadhurst
also give estimates of the TSC. The sound
crossing time can be considered for which the wake feature can be observed. 
We limit the following discussion of the results to the returning scenario.
A definite conclusion about the best fit scenario would require better
knowledge of the time evolution of the shock velocities.

	unlikely to travel at much less than $0.6~v_{3D,1}(t_{col})$ for a

\subsection{Effects of applied prior on output variables}
%\input{3.3_sens_analysis}
\label{sec: sensitivityTests}
We performed tests of how each of the output variables vary according to the
choice of the cutoff of the polarization prior between
$\alpha_{\text{cutoff}} =
29 \degree$ to $49\degree$ instead of $35 \degree$.  
We found that in the most extreme case, choosing the cutoff values as $29
\degree$ ($-6 \degree$), the location of the $v_{3D}(t_{obs})$, is
increased by $ 16 \%$. While the upper $95\%$ CI of $d_{max}$ is
the most sensitive to the prior and it changes by
$\sim 20 \%$ when $\alpha_{\text{cutoff}} = 49 \degree$. 
This shows that the exact choice of the cut off value for $\alpha$ does
not affect our estimates significantly.

\subsection{Three-dimensional (3D) configuration of El Gordo}
%\input{3.4_3D_config}

Many previous studies (van Weeren et al. CITATIONS) have suggested that
$\alpha$ should be small for the detection of double radio relics to be
possible but did not provide quantitative constraints.    

Most of the uncertainty of the parameter estimates come from the projection
angle as shown in Fig (X).
Without the default priors, the Monte Carlo simulation gives the estimate
of the projection angle as 41.7\degree, with the CI = 22.7\degree, 61.14\degree.  
After applying the radio relic polarization prior, the CI shrinks to 
\degree and \degree.
Both estimates are consistent with the estimate of $\alpha > 7.8 \degree$ from
\citet{L13} based on the dynamics of the radio relic. 

More work from N-body magentodynamical simulations is needed to better understand about the physics and the
observable contraints of
radio relics on merger dynamics. from cosmological simulations such as,  
More observational constraints  

(More speculative stuff should be put at the end.)
From this simulation we have shown that it is possible to detect
the double radio relics with $\alpha$ being as big as $61.14\degree$. 
More concrete conclusions can only be drawn with better understanding of
the radio relic properties from simulations and observations. 


\begin{itemize}
\item explains that there hasn't been quantitative constraints on the angle
for which double radio relic can be observed, even though that many studies
have suggested that the detection of radio relic should imply that $\alpha$
should be small. 
From this simulation we have shown that it is possible to detect
the double radio relics with $\alpha$ being as big as $61.14\degree$. 

\item James' paper did mention how the mass estimation depends on $\alpha$,
with the estimated mass being a lot smaller if $\alpha \ge 65\degree$. 
However, since we did use the larger mass estimate as the input of this
simulation, we can only say that the inferred $\alpha$ is consistent with
the mass estimation. 
% angle dependence of observation of radio relic,  this is the first estimate 
% that provides an upper bound on the angle
% for which we can observe double radio relic  
\item discussion of the different scenarios mention in M12:
1) we are viewing after core passage, but before first turn around, and
the merger speed is low"\\
2) the merger speed is high, but we are viewing after the first turn
around as the two components come together for a second core passage
\item discuss the inclination angle estimate from M12
\item Dave: explain where the limits of the projection angle comes
from. what observational evidence contradicts the low velocity
scenario the most
\end{itemize}

With this new piece of evidence, we find that the absence of an
X-ray shock feature from El Gordo, may not be due to the merger speed being
low, as suggested by \citepalias{Jee13}, but due to the long TSC. 
In particular, taking into account that the estimated projection angle of 
$\sim 41.7\degree$, we estimate the projected relative velocity to be 597 \kilo \meter~\second$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the estimated line-of-sight velocity differences of $586 \pm  96~\kilo \meter ~\second^{-1}$ in M12. 

Furthermore, the study from \cite{L13} Lindner et al. has come up
with an estimation of the shock velocity of the radio relic of El Gordo as 
$\sim 4000~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$. While this shock velocity is not the
same as the merger velocity, they should be of similar magnitude. Indeed
our simulation found that a merger velocity of $4000~\kilo
\meter~\second^{-1}$ is within the 95\% credible interval. 

\section{DISCUSSION}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Our finding in the context of other studies of El Gordo}
%\input{4.2_other_studies}
Compare to \citet{L13}.
Compare to \citet{Donnert13} for their best fit scenario.

Initial velocity from Donnert is higher for the hydrodynamical simulations than our
Monte Carlo simulations.

This is reflected by the low probability for our Monte Carlo simulations
to reach $d_max$. This is an aspect that should be further investigated in
future cosmological simulations.


Molnar et al. may have simulated unbound systems, while Donnert and us
simulated bound systems. 


\subsection{Comparison to other merger clusters of galaxies}
%\input{4.3_comparison_merger}

Estimates of the period of El Gordo is smaller than both Musketball and
the Bullet Cluster due to the larger masses of its subclusters. 

Talks about how El Gordo is more massive and collided at higher speed than
both the Bullet and the Musketball, so El Gordo is probably a better probe of SIDM properties.

With this new piece of evidence, we find that the absence of an
X-ray shock feature from El Gordo, may not be due to the merger speed being
low, as suggested by \citetalias{Jee13}. 
In particular, taking into account that the estimated projection angle of 
$\sim 41.7\degree$, we estimate the projected relative velocity to be 597
\kilo \meter~\second$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the estimated
line-of-sight velocity differences of $586 \pm  96~\kilo \meter
~\second^{-1}$ in \citetalias{M12}. 

Furthermore, the study from \cite{L13} Lindner et al. has come up
with an estimation of the shock velocity of the radio relic of El Gordo as 
$\sim 4000~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$. While this shock velocity is not the
same as the merger velocity, they should be of similar magnitude. Indeed
our simulation found that a merger velocity of $4000~\kilo
\meter~\second^{-1}$ is within the 95\% credible interval. 

\subsection{Possible improvements for the radio relic prior}
%\input{4.4_uncertainties_radio_prior}
needs better simulation to understand the physical properties of radio relic.

position information can be used better to constraint the angle / the TSC,
projection effects - can be degenerate according to \cite{S13}   

\subsection{Limitations of our model and future work} 
%\input{4.5_limitations}
Impact parameter of El Gordo may not be negligible. 
Simulations from Ricker \& Sarazin (2001) showed that cool-core is not
disrupted  when the impact parameters of mergers are of the order of $\sim 500$ kpc.   


Due to the highly-correlated nature of the input parameters, 
we suggest simulators for hydrodynamical simulations perform preliminary
calculations when picking their initial conditions.   

For a better Monte Carlo simulation, we seek answers from cosmological
simulations for the following questions about distribution of cluster
properties: 
1) What are the duration after merger for which radio relics are
observable?\\ 
2) What are the typical distribution of impact parameters 
as a ratio of $r_{200c}$ or $m_{200c}$ in cluster mergers?\\ 
3) What are the typical velocities of the radio relic shockwave? 
4)

\section{SUMMARY \& CONCLUSION} (Maybe not needed if there is a discussion)
This paper presents one of the first examples of using the observed radio
relic emission to constrain cluster merger properties.
While we have demonstrated how to use the physical properties of the radio
relic emission to constrain merger dynamics and configurations, many
improvements can still be made as more studies of radio relic are being
done from both cosmological simulations and observations.

Currently, there are only a few studies of
 radio relic available for a range of viewing angles (\citetalias{S13}, one of
Bruggen's paper). As more cosmological simulations inform us  
if the relic is observable at certain viewing angles will help us 
come up with better Monte Carlo filters.

\section{BAYESIAN PRIORS USED FOR DAWSON'S MONTE CARLO SIMULATION}
\label{app:priors}
%\input{app_a_MCMAC_stat_formalism}
The default prior probabilities that we employed can be summarized as
follows for most of the output variables: 
\begin{equation}
	P(TSC_0) = 
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if }TSC_0 < \text{age of universe at } z=0.87	\\
		& 0~\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

In addition, we apply the following prior on $TSC_1$ only when evaluating the
statistics of $TSC_1$, thus allowing realiziations with a valid
outgoing TSC but an invalid returning $TSC_1$. 

\begin{equation}
	P(TSC_1) = 
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if }TSC_1 < \text{age of universe at } z=0.87	\\
		& 0~\text{otherwise} \label{eqn:TSM_1}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

To correct for observational limitations, we further convolve the
posterior probabilities of the different realizations with 
\begin{equation}
	P(TSC_0 | T) = 2 \frac{TSC_0}{T}
\end{equation}
to account for how the subclusters move faster at lower $TSC$ and thus it
is more probable to observe the subclusters at a stage with a larger $TSC$.
