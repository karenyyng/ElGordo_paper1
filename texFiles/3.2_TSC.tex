\textbf{The simulation gives two plausible estimates for
the time-since-collision, with $TSC_0 = \giga \text{yr}$ and $TSC_1 = \giga
\text{yr}$}. Based on section \ref{sec: positionprior}, we have come up
with estimates for the position of the NW radio relic based on the two PDFs
of inferred TSC as shown in figure \ref{fig: positionprior}. We plotted
the PDF of the simulated positions of the relic for the outgoing scenario
(blue) and the incoming scenario (green) against
the observed position of the relic (red), with the width of the red
relic accounting for the reported physical width ($23$ kpc)of the relic along the
merger axis \citep{L13}. When we
assume $\langle v_{relic} \rangle / v_{3D,1}(t_{col}) = 1.0$ (uppermost
panel of Figure \ref{fig: positionprior}), which is approximately the upper
limit of how fast the shock can travel, the outgoing scenario is much more
favored. As we examine a decreased ratio of  $\langle v_{relic} \rangle /
v_{3D,1}(t_{col})$, we probe how much the shock could have slowed down
and still be consistent with the outgoing scenario. Figure \ref{fig:
positionprior} shows that if $\langle v_{relic} \rangle
\lesssim 0.6$, the outgoing scenario would be favored. \par 
	We intrepret Figure \ref{fig: positionprior} to favor
the outgoing scenario over the incoming scenario due to the following
reasons: 1) Both \citet{Springel2007} and \citet{Kang2007} showed a
more-or-less constant speed of the shock as the shock propagates out
from the merger center. 2) In order for the incoming scenario to be more
favorable, the shock has to travel significantly slower than $0.6~
v_{3D}(t_{col})$ for a significant period of time. With reasons listed
above, we present the rest of the results and figures based on the outgoing
scenario in the main text of this paper and leave the results for the
incoming scenario in Appendix \ref{app: results}. 

Other uncertainties arise from how we define the reference frame for the calculation. The
uncertainty associated with the two centroids are of the order
of $\sim 0.1 \mega$pc \citep{Jee13} and are relatively unimportant???.

	predicted position from the two simulated merger scenarios (blue for
	outgoing and green for the incoming scenario). The outgoing scenario
	is more favored than the incoming scenario since the shock speed is
	unlikely to travel at much less than $0.6 v_{3D,1}(t_{col}$ for a
	significant period of time. Default priors were
	used for this figure. Alternate version of this figure with the polarization prior applied can

%We pick the post-collision time-since-collision estimate ($TSC_0$) of Gyr to be representative of the observed status of El Gordo, instead of the pre-collision time-since-collision estimate ($TSC_1$). While the simulation models both scenarios either the subclusters are approaching each other (incoming) or they have already passed through each
%other and are moving apart (outgoing), the presence of the radio relic rules out the possibility that the two subclusters still have not encountered each other.
