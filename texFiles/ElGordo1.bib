abstract = {We investigate the gravitational lensing properties of dark matter halos with Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) density profiles and derive an analytic expression for the radial dependence of the shear, \$\backslash gamma(x)\$, due to these objects. In addition, we derive an expression for the mean shear interior to a given radius, \$\backslash bar\{\backslash gamma\}(x)\$, and use this to quantify systematic errors that will arise in weak lensing mass estimates of astronomical objects in the case that the mass estimate is based on an a priori assumption that the underlying potential is that of a singular isothermal sphere when, in fact, the potential is that of an NFW-type object. On mass scales between \$10\^{}\{11\} \backslash Msun \backslash ls M\_\{200\} \backslash ls 10\^{}\{15\} \backslash Msun\$, the assumption of an isothermal sphere potential results in an overestimate of the halo mass, and the amount by which the mass is overestimated increases linearly with the value of the NFW concentration parameter. Considerable overestimates of the mass (\$\backslash sim 60\%\$) can occur for galaxy-sized halos, but for rich clusters the mass overestimate is small. The degree to which the mass is systematically in error is dependent upon the cosmology adopted, with a COBE-normalized standard CDM model yielding the largest systematic errors for a given true value of the halo mass.},

We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution from both strong and weak gravitational lensing data. Multi-color, high-resolution HST ACS images allow detection of many more arc candidates than were previously known, especially around the subcluster. Using the known redshift of one of the multiply imaged systems, we determine the remaining source redshifts using the predictive power of the strong lens model. Combining this information with shape measurements of "weakly" lensed sources, we derive a high-resolution, absolutely-calibrated mass map, using no assumptions regarding the physical properties of the underlying cluster potential. This map provides the best available quantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster. We also confirm the result from Clowe et al. (2004,2006a).},

abstract = {In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster can be derived if no further informations besides image ellipticities are used. Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can be used successfully in practice.},

Using hydrodynamical +N-body AMR simulations of the merger between three initially hydrostatic clusters in an idealised setup, we are able to reconstruct the morphology of the radio relic. Based on our simulation, we can constrain the merger geometry, predict lensing mass measurements and X-ray observations. Comparing such models to X-ray, redshift and lensing data will validate the geometry of this complex merger which helps to constrain the parameters for shock acceleration of electrons that produces the radio relic.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters grow by mergers with other clusters and galaxy groups. These mergers create shocks within the intracluster medium (ICM). It is proposed that within the shocks particles can be accelerated to extreme energies. In the presence of a magnetic field these particles should then form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation, creating so-called radio relics. An example of a cluster with relics is CIZA J2242.8+5301. Here we present hydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster collisions with the aim of constraining the merger scenario for this cluster. We conclude that by using the location, size and width of double radio relics we can set constraints on the mass ratios, impact parameters, timescales, and viewing geometries of binary cluster merger events.},

abstract = {The Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56) merger is of exceptional interest for testing the standard cold-dark-matter plus cosmological constant cosmological model, and for investigating the possible existence of a long- or short-range "fifth-force" in the dark sector and possible need for modifications of general relativity or even of Newtonian gravity. The most recent previous simulations of the Bullet Cluster merger required an initial infall velocity far in excess of what would be expected within the standard cosmological model, at least in the absence of additional forces or modifications to gravity. We have carried out much more detailed simulations, making pixel-by-pixel fits to 2D data-maps of the mass distribution and X-ray emission, allowing for triaxial initial configurations and including MHD and cooling. Here, we compare the initial conditions of the Bullet Cluster merger to those in similar-mass merging clusters in the Horizon cosmological simulation. We conclude that the observed properties of the Bullet Cluster are completely consistent with Lambda-CDM.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 "El Gordo," likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect cluster known at z>0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg\^{}2. Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of Tx=14.5+/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of Lx=(2.19+/-0.11)x10\^{}45 h70\^{}-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of M200a=(2.16+/-0.32)x10\^{}15 M\_sun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6+/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22+/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {Simulations of isolated binary mergers of galaxy clusters are a useful tool to study the evolution of these objects. For exceptionally massive systems they even represent the only viable way of simulation, because these are rare in typical cosmological simulations. We present a new practical model for these simulations based on the Hernquist dark matter profile. The hydrostatic equation is solved for a beta-model with \$\backslash beta\$ = 2/3 in this potential and approximate expressions for X-ray brightness and Compton-y parameter are derived. We show in detail how to setup such a system using SPH. The theoretical and several numerical models are compared to observed scaling relations of galaxy clusters and satisfactory agreement with the self-similar relations is found. The model is then applied to investigate the observed cluster ACT-CT J0102-4915 (El Gordo), a particularly massive merging high redshift cluster. We are able to reproduce the X-ray luminosity, SZ-effect and dark matter core distance as well as the rough shape of the observed cluster for reasonable model parameters. The lack of substruc- ture prevents us from obtaining the fluctuations observed in the wake of the system and we argue that the parent cluster of the system was highly disturbed even before the main merger observed today.},

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies, as the largest virialized systems in the Universe, are ideal laboratories to study the formation and evolution of cosmic structures...(abridged)... Most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of ICM through X-ray Astronomy. At the same time, radio observations have proved that the ICM is mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium. They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in galaxy clusters: halos, relics and mini-halos. We discuss their classification and properties. We report published results up to date and obtain and discuss statistical properties. We present the properties of large-scale magnetic fields in clusters and in even larger structures: filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We summarize the current models of the origin of these cluster components, and outline the improvements that are expected in this area from future developments thanks to the new generation of radio telescopes.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present a HST weak-lensing study of the merging galaxy cluster "El Gordo" (ACT-CL J0102-4915) at z=0.87 discovered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration as the strongest SZ decrement in its \~{}1000 sq. deg survey. Our weak-lensing analysis confirms that ACT-CL J0102-4915 is indeed an extreme system consisting of two massive (\~{}10\^{}15 Msun each) subclusters with a projected separation of \~{}0.7 Mpc. This binary mass structure revealed by our lensing study is consistent with the cluster galaxy distribution and the dynamical study carried out with 89 spectroscopic members. We estimate the mass of ACT-CL J0102-4915 by simultaneously fitting two axisymmetric NFW profiles allowing their centers to vary. Our MCMC analysis shows that the masses of the northwestern (NW) and the southeastern (SE) components are M200c=(1.40+-0.31) x 10\^{}15 Msun and (0.75+-0.17) x 10\^{}15 Msun, respectively. The lensing-based velocity dispersions are consistent with their spectroscopic measurements. The centroids of both components are tightly constrained (\~{}4") and close to the optical luminosity centers. The X-ray and mass peaks are spatially offset by \~{}13" (\~{}100 kpc), which is significant at the \~{}3 sigma confidence level and confirms that the baryonic and dark matter in this cluster are disassociated. The dark matter peak, however, does not lead the gas peak in the direction expected if we are viewing the cluster soon after first core passage during a high speed merger. Under the assumption that the merger is happening in the plane of the sky, extrapolation of the two NFW halos to a radius r200a=2.4 Mpc yields a combined mass of M200a=(3.10+-0.70) x 10\^{}15 Msun. This extrapolated total mass is consistent with our two-component-based dynamical analysis and previous X-ray measurements, projecting ACT-CL J0102-4915 to be the most massive cluster at z>0.6 known to date.},

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to ?. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled accord- ing to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first compo- nent of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward effi- ciency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. 1.},

abstract = {We present evidence for the existence of shock waves caused by the formation of the large-scale structure. In some clusters of galaxies peripherally located sources of extended diffuse radio emission exist, the so-called cluster radio relics. They have steep radio spectra but no apparent cutoff, as old remnants of radio galaxies usually have. Therefore particle acceleration has to take place within them. We propose that shock structures of the cosmological large-scale matter flows are responsible for the acceleration of relativistic electrons: cluster accretion shocks and bow shocks of merger events. We develop a theory of radio plasma having traversed these shocks and compare it to observational data of nine radio relics (0038-096, 0917+75, 1140+203, 1253+275, 1712+64, 1706+78, 2006-56, 2010-57, 1401-33) and their host clusters (A85, A786, A1367, Coma, A2255, A2256, A3667, S753). The necessary accretion power, the spectral index of the radio spectrum, the acceleration efficiency of the shock, the diffusion coefficient in the post-shock region, and the predicted radio polarization in all of our examples fit into a coherent interpretation of the observational data. Since polarization measurements are available only for four sources, the predictions of our theory can be independently checked using other examples. The predicted values of the shock compression ratio, density and temperature of the infalling gas, magnetic field strength of the shocked and unshocked radio plasma are discussed within the frame of structure formation theory.},

abstract = {We present 610 MHz and 2.1 GHz imaging of the massive SZE-selected z=0.870 cluster merger ACT-CL J0102-4915 (El Gordo), obtained with the GMRT and the ATCA, respectively. We detect two complexes of radio relics separated by 3.4' (1.6 Mpc) along the system's NW-to-SE collision axis that have high integrated polarizations (33\%) and steep spectral indices, consistent with creation via Fermi acceleration by shocks in the ICM. From the spectral index of the relics, we compute a Mach number of 2.55 and shock speed of 4300\^{}\{+800\}\_\{-500\} km/s. With our ATCA data, we compute the Faraday rotation measure across the NW relic and find a mean value of 11 rad/m\^{}2 and standard deviation of 6 rad/m\^{}2. With the integrated line-of-sight gas density derived from new Chandra observations, our RM measurement implies B\_parallel\~{}0.01 $\backslash$mu G in the cluster outskirts. The extremely narrow shock widths in the relics (<23 kpc) prevent us from placing a meaningful constraint on |B| using cooling time arguments. In addition to the relics, we detect a large (1.1 Mpc radius), powerful (log L\_1.4[W/Hz]= 25.66+-0.05) radio halo with a Bullet-like morphology. The spectral-index map of the halo shows the synchrotron spectrum is flattest near the relics, along the collision axis, and in regions of high T\_gas, all locations associated with recent energy injection. The spatial and spectral correlation between the halo emission and cluster X-ray properties supports primary-electron processes like turbulent reacceleration as the halo production mechanism. The halo's integrated 610 MHz to 2.1 GHz spectral index is 1.25+-0.05, consistent with the cluster's high T\_gas in view of previously established global scaling relations. El Gordo is the highest-redshift cluster known to host a radio halo and/or radio relics, and provides new constraints on the non-thermal physics in clusters at z>0.6. [abridged]},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters form through a sequence of mergers of smaller galaxy clusters and groups. Models of diffusive shock acceleration suggest that in shocks that occur during cluster mergers, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, similar to conditions within supernova remnants. In the presence of magnetic fields, these particles emit synchrotron radiation and may form so-called radio relics. We detected a radio relic that displays highly aligned magnetic fields, a strong spectral index gradient, and a narrow relic width, giving a measure of the magnetic field in an unexplored site of the universe. Our observations show that diffusive shock acceleration also operates on scales much larger than in supernova remnants and that shocks in galaxy clusters are capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays.},

abstract = {This paper is the second in a series describing the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) being carried out at 843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). The survey will consist of [\~{}]590 4.3\{degrees\}x 4.3\{degrees\} mosaic images with 45 x 45 cosec|\{delta\}| arcsec2 resolution, and a source catalogue. In this paper we describe the initial release (version 1.0) of the source catalogue consisting of 107 765 radio sources made by fitting elliptical Gaussians in 271 SUMSS 4.3\{degrees\}x 4.3\{degrees\} mosaics to a limiting peak brightness of 6 mJy beam-1 at \{delta\}[\&le;]-50\{degrees\} and 10 mJy beam-1 at \{delta\} > -50\{degrees\}. The catalogue covers approximately 3500 deg2 of the southern sky with \{delta\}[\&le;]-30\{degrees\}, about 43 per cent of the total survey area. Positions in the catalogue are accurate to within 1-2 arcsec for sources with peak brightness A843[\&ge;] 20 mJy beam-1 and are always better than 10 arcsec. The internal flux density scale is accurate to within 3 per cent. Image artefacts have been classified using a decision tree, which correctly identifies and rejects spurious sources in over 96 per cent of cases. Analysis of the catalogue shows that it is highly uniform and is complete to 8 mJy at \{delta\}[\&le;]-50\{degrees\} and 18 mJy at \{delta\} > -50\{degrees\}. In this release of the catalogue about 7000 sources are found in the overlap region with the National Radio Astronomy Observatories Very Large Array Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz. We calculate a median spectral index of =-0.83 between 1.4 GHz and 843 MHz. This version of the catalogue will be released via the World Wide Web with future updates as new mosaics are released.},

abstract = {We present the first dynamical mass estimates and scaling relations for a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected galaxy clusters. The sample consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over a 455 sq. deg. area of the southern sky. Deep multi-object spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution (R\~{}700-800) spectra and redshifts for \~{}60 member galaxies on average per cluster. The dynamical masses M\_200c of the clusters have been calculated using simulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The sample has a median redshift z=0.50 and a median mass M\_200c\~{}12e14 Msun/h70 with a lower limit M\_200c\~{}6e14 Msun/h70, consistent with the expectations for the ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE properties of the sample, specifically, the match-filtered central SZE amplitude y, the central Compton parameter y0, and the integrated Compton signal Y\_200c, which we use to derive SZE-Mass scaling relations. All SZE estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (<\~{}20\%), in agreement with numerical simulations. We explore the effects of various systematic effects on these scaling relations, including the correlation between observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters. Using the 3-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters and find that \~{}50\% of the clusters are disturbed. There are hints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations but given the current sample sizes these differences are not significant; further studies including more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on the scaling relations.},

abstract = {We present 610 MHz and 2.1 GHz imaging of the massive SZE-selected z=0.870 cluster merger ACT-CL J0102-4915 (El Gordo), obtained with the GMRT and the ATCA, respectively. We detect two complexes of radio relics separated by 3.4' (1.6 Mpc) along the system's NW-to-SE collision axis that have high integrated polarizations (33\%) and steep spectral indices, consistent with creation via Fermi acceleration by shocks in the ICM. From the spectral index of the relics, we compute a Mach number of 2.55 and shock speed of 4300\^{}\{+800\}\_\{-500\} km/s. With our ATCA data, we compute the Faraday rotation measure across the NW relic and find a mean value of 11 rad/m\^{}2 and standard deviation of 6 rad/m\^{}2. With the integrated line-of-sight gas density derived from new Chandra observations, our RM measurement implies B\_parallel\~{}0.01 $\backslash$mu G in the cluster outskirts. The extremely narrow shock widths in the relics (<23 kpc) prevent us from placing a meaningful constraint on |B| using cooling time arguments. In addition to the relics, we detect a large (1.1 Mpc radius), powerful (log L\_1.4[W/Hz]= 25.66+-0.05) radio halo with a Bullet-like morphology. The spectral-index map of the halo shows the synchrotron spectrum is flattest near the relics, along the collision axis, and in regions of high T\_gas, all locations associated with recent energy injection. The spatial and spectral correlation between the halo emission and cluster X-ray properties supports primary-electron processes like turbulent reacceleration as the halo production mechanism. The halo's integrated 610 MHz to 2.1 GHz spectral index is 1.25+-0.05, consistent with the cluster's high T\_gas in view of previously established global scaling relations. El Gordo is the highest-redshift cluster known to host a radio halo and/or radio relics, and provides new constraints on the non-thermal physics in clusters at z>0.6. [abridged]},

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies, as the largest virialized systems in the Universe, are ideal laboratories to study the formation and evolution of cosmic structures...(abridged)... Most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of ICM through X-ray Astronomy. At the same time, radio observations have proved that the ICM is mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium. They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in galaxy clusters: halos, relics and mini-halos. We discuss their classification and properties. We report published results up to date and obtain and discuss statistical properties. We present the properties of large-scale magnetic fields in clusters and in even larger structures: filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We summarize the current models of the origin of these cluster components, and outline the improvements that are expected in this area from future developments thanks to the new generation of radio telescopes.},

@article{Randall2002,
abstract = {In the standard Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation, massive clusters form via the merger of smaller clusters. N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxy clusters have shown that mergers can temporarily boost the X-ray luminosity and temperature of the merged cluster above the equilibrium values for the merged system. The cumulative effect of these "merger boosts" will affect the observed X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) and temperature functions (TFs) of clusters. Merger boosts may bias the values of sigma\_8 and Omega\_0 inferred from cluster XLFs and TFs if virial equilibrium is assumed. We use a semi-analytic technique to estimate the effect of merger boosts on the X-ray luminosity and temperature functions. The boosts from individual mergers are derived from N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of mergers. The statistics of the merger histories of clusters are determined from extended Press-Schechter (PS) merger trees. We find that merger boosts can increase the apparent number of hot, luminous clusters. For example, in a Universe with Omega\_0 = 0.3 and Omega\_Lambda = 0.7 at a redshift of z=1, the number of clusters with temperatures T > 10 keV is increased by a factor of 9.5, and the number of clusters with luminosities L\_X > 5x10\^{}44 h\^{}-2 erg/s is increased by a factor of 8.9. We have used our merger-boosted TFs and XLFs to derive the cosmological structure parameters sigma\_8 and Omega\_0 by fitting Press-Schechter equilibrium relations to local (z=0) and distant (either z=0.5 or z=1) cluster samples. Merger boosts cause sigma\_8 to be overestimated by about 20\%. The matter density parameter Omega\_0 may be underestimated by about 20\%, although this result is less clear.},

abstract = {We present 610 MHz and 2.1 GHz imaging of the massive SZE-selected z=0.870 cluster merger ACT-CL J0102-4915 (El Gordo), obtained with the GMRT and the ATCA, respectively. We detect two complexes of radio relics separated by 3.4' (1.6 Mpc) along the system's NW-to-SE collision axis that have high integrated polarizations (33\%) and steep spectral indices, consistent with creation via Fermi acceleration by shocks in the ICM. From the spectral index of the relics, we compute a Mach number of 2.55 and shock speed of 4300\^{}\{+800\}\_\{-500\} km/s. With our ATCA data, we compute the Faraday rotation measure across the NW relic and find a mean value of 11 rad/m\^{}2 and standard deviation of 6 rad/m\^{}2. With the integrated line-of-sight gas density derived from new Chandra observations, our RM measurement implies B\_parallel\~{}0.01 $\backslash$mu G in the cluster outskirts. The extremely narrow shock widths in the relics (<23 kpc) prevent us from placing a meaningful constraint on |B| using cooling time arguments. In addition to the relics, we detect a large (1.1 Mpc radius), powerful (log L\_1.4[W/Hz]= 25.66+-0.05) radio halo with a Bullet-like morphology. The spectral-index map of the halo shows the synchrotron spectrum is flattest near the relics, along the collision axis, and in regions of high T\_gas, all locations associated with recent energy injection. The spatial and spectral correlation between the halo emission and cluster X-ray properties supports primary-electron processes like turbulent reacceleration as the halo production mechanism. The halo's integrated 610 MHz to 2.1 GHz spectral index is 1.25+-0.05, consistent with the cluster's high T\_gas in view of previously established global scaling relations. El Gordo is the highest-redshift cluster known to host a radio halo and/or radio relics, and provides new constraints on the non-thermal physics in clusters at z>0.6. [abridged]},

Using hydrodynamical +N-body AMR simulations of the merger between three initially hydrostatic clusters in an idealised setup, we are able to reconstruct the morphology of the radio relic. Based on our simulation, we can constrain the merger geometry, predict lensing mass measurements and X-ray observations. Comparing such models to X-ray, redshift and lensing data will validate the geometry of this complex merger which helps to constrain the parameters for shock acceleration of electrons that produces the radio relic.},

@article{D13,
abstract = {Merging galaxy clusters have become one of the most important probes of dark matter, providing evidence for dark matter over modified gravity and even constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section. To properly constrain the dark matter cross-section it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the merger, as the inferred cross-section is a function of both the velocity of the collision and the observed time since collision. While the best understanding of merging system dynamics comes from N-body simulations, these are computationally intensive and often explore only a limited volume of the merger phase space allowed by observed parameter uncertainty. Simple analytic models exist but the assumptions of these methods invalidate their results near the collision time, plus error propagation of the highly correlated merger parameters is unfeasible. To address these weaknesses I develop a Monte Carlo method to discern the properties of dissociative mergers and propagate the uncertainty of the measured cluster parameters in an accurate and Bayesian manner. I introduce this method, verify it against an existing hydrodynamic N-body simulation, and apply it to two known dissociative mergers: 1ES 0657-558 (Bullet Cluster) and DLSCL J0916.2+2951 (Musket Ball Cluster). I find that this method surpasses existing analytic models - providing accurate (10\% level) dynamic parameter and uncertainty estimates throughout the merger history. This coupled with minimal required a priori information (subcluster mass, redshift, and projected separation) and relatively fast computation (\~{}6 CPU hours) makes this method ideal for large samples of dissociative merging clusters.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present a HST weak-lensing study of the merging galaxy cluster "El Gordo" (ACT-CL J0102-4915) at z=0.87 discovered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration as the strongest SZ decrement in its \~{}1000 sq. deg survey. Our weak-lensing analysis confirms that ACT-CL J0102-4915 is indeed an extreme system consisting of two massive (\~{}10\^{}15 Msun each) subclusters with a projected separation of \~{}0.7 Mpc. This binary mass structure revealed by our lensing study is consistent with the cluster galaxy distribution and the dynamical study carried out with 89 spectroscopic members. We estimate the mass of ACT-CL J0102-4915 by simultaneously fitting two axisymmetric NFW profiles allowing their centers to vary. Our MCMC analysis shows that the masses of the northwestern (NW) and the southeastern (SE) components are M200c=(1.40+-0.31) x 10\^{}15 Msun and (0.75+-0.17) x 10\^{}15 Msun, respectively. The lensing-based velocity dispersions are consistent with their spectroscopic measurements. The centroids of both components are tightly constrained (\~{}4") and close to the optical luminosity centers. The X-ray and mass peaks are spatially offset by \~{}13" (\~{}100 kpc), which is significant at the \~{}3 sigma confidence level and confirms that the baryonic and dark matter in this cluster are disassociated. The dark matter peak, however, does not lead the gas peak in the direction expected if we are viewing the cluster soon after first core passage during a high speed merger. Under the assumption that the merger is happening in the plane of the sky, extrapolation of the two NFW halos to a radius r200a=2.4 Mpc yields a combined mass of M200a=(3.10+-0.70) x 10\^{}15 Msun. This extrapolated total mass is consistent with our two-component-based dynamical analysis and previous X-ray measurements, projecting ACT-CL J0102-4915 to be the most massive cluster at z>0.6 known to date.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the question why cluster radio relics that are connected to shock acceleration, so-called radio gischt, have preferentially been found in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. By identifying merger shock waves in cosmological grid simulations, we explore several prescriptions for relating the energy dissipated in shocks to the energy emitted in the radio band. None of the investigated models produce detectable radio relics within 100-200 kpc from the cluster centre. All models cause > 50 per cent of the detectable relic emission at projected distances > 800 kpc. Central radio relics caused by shocks that propagate along the line-of-sight are rare events for simple geometrical reasons, and they have a low surface brightness making them elusive for current instruments. Our simulations show that the radial distribution of observed relics can be explained by the radial trend of dissipated kinetic energy in shocks, that increases with distance from the cluster centre up until half of the virial radius.},

abstract = {The distinctive cometary X-ray morphology of the recently discovered massive galaxy cluster "El Gordo" (ACT-CT J0102-4915; z=0.87) indicates that an unusually high-speed collision is ongoing between two massive galaxy clusters. A bright X-ray "bullet" leads a "twin-tailed" wake, with the SZ centroid at the end of the Northern tail. We show how the physical properties of this system can be determined using our FLASH-based, N-body/hydrodynamic model, constrained by detailed X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and Hubble lensing and dynamical data. The X-ray morphology and the location of the two Dark Matter components and the SZ peak are accurately described by a simple binary collision viewed about 480 million years after the first core passage. We derive an impact parameter of \~{}300 kpc, and a relative initial infall velocity of \~{}2250 km/sec when separated by the sum of the two virial radii assuming an initial total mass of 2.15x10\^{}(15) Msun and a mass ratio of 1.9. Our model demonstrates that tidally stretched gas accounts for the Northern X-ray tail along the collision axis between the mass peaks, and that the Southern tail lies off axis, comprising compressed and shock heated gas generated as the massive component plunges through the main cluster. The challenge for LCDM will be to find out if this physically extreme event can be plausibly accommodated when combined with the similarly massive, high infall velocity case of the "Bullet cluster" and other such cases being uncovered in the new SZ based surveys.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 "El Gordo," likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect cluster known at z>0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg\^{}2. Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of Tx=14.5+/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of Lx=(2.19+/-0.11)x10\^{}45 h70\^{}-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of M200a=(2.16+/-0.32)x10\^{}15 M\_sun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6+/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22+/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies, as the largest virialized systems in the Universe, are ideal laboratories to study the formation and evolution of cosmic structures...(abridged)... Most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of ICM through X-ray Astronomy. At the same time, radio observations have proved that the ICM is mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium. They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in galaxy clusters: halos, relics and mini-halos. We discuss their classification and properties. We report published results up to date and obtain and discuss statistical properties. We present the properties of large-scale magnetic fields in clusters and in even larger structures: filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We summarize the current models of the origin of these cluster components, and outline the improvements that are expected in this area from future developments thanks to the new generation of radio telescopes.},

It is proposed that within the shocks particles can be accelerated to extreme energies. In the presence of a magnetic field these particles should then form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation, creating so-called radio relics. An example of a cluster with relics is CIZA J2242.8+5301. Here we present hydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster collisions with the aim of constraining the merger scenario for this cluster.

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to ?. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled accord- ing to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first compo- nent of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward effi- ciency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. 1.},

@article{Randall2002,
abstract = {In the standard Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation, massive clusters form via the merger of smaller clusters. N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxy clusters have shown that mergers can temporarily boost the X-ray luminosity and temperature of the merged cluster above the equilibrium values for the merged system. The cumulative effect of these "merger boosts" will affect the observed X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) and temperature functions (TFs) of clusters. Merger boosts may bias the values of sigma\_8 and Omega\_0 inferred from cluster XLFs and TFs if virial equilibrium is assumed. We use a semi-analytic technique to estimate the effect of merger boosts on the X-ray luminosity and temperature functions. The boosts from individual mergers are derived from N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of mergers. The statistics of the merger histories of clusters are determined from extended Press-Schechter (PS) merger trees. We find that merger boosts can increase the apparent number of hot, luminous clusters. For example, in a Universe with Omega\_0 = 0.3 and Omega\_Lambda = 0.7 at a redshift of z=1, the number of clusters with temperatures T > 10 keV is increased by a factor of 9.5, and the number of clusters with luminosities L\_X > 5x10\^{}44 h\^{}-2 erg/s is increased by a factor of 8.9. We have used our merger-boosted TFs and XLFs to derive the cosmological structure parameters sigma\_8 and Omega\_0 by fitting Press-Schechter equilibrium relations to local (z=0) and distant (either z=0.5 or z=1) cluster samples. Merger boosts cause sigma\_8 to be overestimated by about 20\%. The matter density parameter Omega\_0 may be underestimated by about 20\%, although this result is less clear.},

@article{D13,
abstract = {Merging galaxy clusters have become one of the most important probes of dark matter, providing evidence for dark matter over modified gravity and even constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section. To properly constrain the dark matter cross-section it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the merger, as the inferred cross-section is a function of both the velocity of the collision and the observed time since collision. While the best understanding of merging system dynamics comes from N-body simulations, these are computationally intensive and often explore only a limited volume of the merger phase space allowed by observed parameter uncertainty. Simple analytic models exist but the assumptions of these methods invalidate their results near the collision time, plus error propagation of the highly correlated merger parameters is unfeasible. To address these weaknesses I develop a Monte Carlo method to discern the properties of dissociative mergers and propagate the uncertainty of the measured cluster parameters in an accurate and Bayesian manner. I introduce this method, verify it against an existing hydrodynamic N-body simulation, and apply it to two known dissociative mergers: 1ES 0657-558 (Bullet Cluster) and DLSCL J0916.2+2951 (Musket Ball Cluster). I find that this method surpasses existing analytic models - providing accurate (10\% level) dynamic parameter and uncertainty estimates throughout the merger history. This coupled with minimal required a priori information (subcluster mass, redshift, and projected separation) and relatively fast computation (\~{}6 CPU hours) makes this method ideal for large samples of dissociative merging clusters.},

Models of diffusive shock acceleration suggest that in shocks that occur during cluster mergers, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, similar to conditions within supernova remnants. In the presence of magnetic fields, these particles emit synchrotron radiation and may form so-called radio relics. We detected a radio relic that displays highly aligned magnetic fields, a strong spectral index gradient, and a narrow relic width, giving a measure of the magnetic field in an unexplored site of the universe. Our observations show that diffusive shock acceleration also operates on scales much larger than in supernova remnants and that shocks in galaxy clusters are capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present a HST weak-lensing study of the merging galaxy cluster "El Gordo" (ACT-CL J0102-4915) at z=0.87 discovered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration as the strongest SZ decrement in its \~{}1000 sq. deg survey. Our weak-lensing analysis confirms that ACT-CL J0102-4915 is indeed an extreme system consisting of two massive (\~{}10\^{}15 Msun each) subclusters with a projected separation of \~{}0.7 Mpc. This binary mass structure revealed by our lensing study is consistent with the cluster galaxy distribution and the dynamical study carried out with 89 spectroscopic members. We estimate the mass of ACT-CL J0102-4915 by simultaneously fitting two axisymmetric NFW profiles allowing their centers to vary. Our MCMC analysis shows that the masses of the northwestern (NW) and the southeastern (SE) components are M200c=(1.40+-0.31) x 10\^{}15 Msun and (0.75+-0.17) x 10\^{}15 Msun, respectively. The lensing-based velocity dispersions are consistent with their spectroscopic measurements. The centroids of both components are tightly constrained (\~{}4") and close to the optical luminosity centers. The X-ray and mass peaks are spatially offset by \~{}13" (\~{}100 kpc), which is significant at the \~{}3 sigma confidence level and confirms that the baryonic and dark matter in this cluster are disassociated. The dark matter peak, however, does not lead the gas peak in the direction expected if we are viewing the cluster soon after first core passage during a high speed merger. Under the assumption that the merger is happening in the plane of the sky, extrapolation of the two NFW halos to a radius r200a=2.4 Mpc yields a combined mass of M200a=(3.10+-0.70) x 10\^{}15 Msun. This extrapolated total mass is consistent with our two-component-based dynamical analysis and previous X-ray measurements, projecting ACT-CL J0102-4915 to be the most massive cluster at z>0.6 known to date.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 "El Gordo," likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect cluster known at z>0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg\^{}2. Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of Tx=14.5+/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of Lx=(2.19+/-0.11)x10\^{}45 h70\^{}-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of M200a=(2.16+/-0.32)x10\^{}15 M\_sun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6+/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22+/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {We present the first dynamical mass estimates and scaling relations for a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected galaxy clusters. The sample consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over a 455 sq. deg. area of the southern sky. Deep multi-object spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution (R\~{}700-800) spectra and redshifts for \~{}60 member galaxies on average per cluster. The dynamical masses M\_200c of the clusters have been calculated using simulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The sample has a median redshift z=0.50 and a median mass M\_200c\~{}12e14 Msun/h70 with a lower limit M\_200c\~{}6e14 Msun/h70, consistent with the expectations for the ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE properties of the sample, specifically, the match-filtered central SZE amplitude y, the central Compton parameter y0, and the integrated Compton signal Y\_200c, which we use to derive SZE-Mass scaling relations. All SZE estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (<\~{}20\%), in agreement with numerical simulations. We explore the effects of various systematic effects on these scaling relations, including the correlation between observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters. Using the 3-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters and find that \~{}50\% of the clusters are disturbed. There are hints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations but given the current sample sizes these differences are not significant; further studies including more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on the scaling relations.},

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies, as the largest virialized systems in the Universe, are ideal laboratories to study the formation and evolution of cosmic structures...(abridged)... Most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of ICM through X-ray Astronomy. At the same time, radio observations have proved that the ICM is mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium. They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in galaxy clusters: halos, relics and mini-halos. We discuss their classification and properties. We report published results up to date and obtain and discuss statistical properties. We present the properties of large-scale magnetic fields in clusters and in even larger structures: filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We summarize the current models of the origin of these cluster components, and outline the improvements that are expected in this area from future developments thanks to the new generation of radio telescopes.},

abstract = {Simulations of isolated binary mergers of galaxy clusters are a useful tool to study the evolution of these objects. For exceptionally massive systems they even represent the only viable way of simulation, because these are rare in typical cosmological simulations. We present a new practical model for these simulations based on the Hernquist dark matter profile. The hydrostatic equation is solved for a beta-model with \$\backslash beta\$ = 2/3 in this potential and approximate expressions for X-ray brightness and Compton-y parameter are derived. We show in detail how to setup such a system using SPH. The theoretical and several numerical models are compared to observed scaling relations of galaxy clusters and satisfactory agreement with the self-similar relations is found. The model is then applied to investigate the observed cluster ACT-CT J0102-4915 (El Gordo), a particularly massive merging high redshift cluster. We are able to reproduce the X-ray luminosity, SZ-effect and dark matter core distance as well as the rough shape of the observed cluster for reasonable model parameters. The lack of substruc- ture prevents us from obtaining the fluctuations observed in the wake of the system and we argue that the parent cluster of the system was highly disturbed even before the main merger observed today.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to ?. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled accord- ing to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first compo- nent of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward effi- ciency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. 1.},

@article{D13,
abstract = {Merging galaxy clusters have become one of the most important probes of dark matter, providing evidence for dark matter over modified gravity and even constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section. To properly constrain the dark matter cross-section it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the merger, as the inferred cross-section is a function of both the velocity of the collision and the observed time since collision. While the best understanding of merging system dynamics comes from N-body simulations, these are computationally intensive and often explore only a limited volume of the merger phase space allowed by observed parameter uncertainty. Simple analytic models exist but the assumptions of these methods invalidate their results near the collision time, plus error propagation of the highly correlated merger parameters is unfeasible. To address these weaknesses I develop a Monte Carlo method to discern the properties of dissociative mergers and propagate the uncertainty of the measured cluster parameters in an accurate and Bayesian manner. I introduce this method, verify it against an existing hydrodynamic N-body simulation, and apply it to two known dissociative mergers: 1ES 0657-558 (Bullet Cluster) and DLSCL J0916.2+2951 (Musket Ball Cluster). I find that this method surpasses existing analytic models - providing accurate (10\% level) dynamic parameter and uncertainty estimates throughout the merger history. This coupled with minimal required a priori information (subcluster mass, redshift, and projected separation) and relatively fast computation (\~{}6 CPU hours) makes this method ideal for large samples of dissociative merging clusters.},

abstract = {We investigate the gravitational lensing properties of dark matter halos with Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) density profiles and derive an analytic expression for the radial dependence of the shear, \$\backslash gamma(x)\$, due to these objects. In addition, we derive an expression for the mean shear interior to a given radius, \$\backslash bar\{\backslash gamma\}(x)\$, and use this to quantify systematic errors that will arise in weak lensing mass estimates of astronomical objects in the case that the mass estimate is based on an a priori assumption that the underlying potential is that of a singular isothermal sphere when, in fact, the potential is that of an NFW-type object. On mass scales between \$10\^{}\{11\} \backslash Msun \backslash ls M\_\{200\} \backslash ls 10\^{}\{15\} \backslash Msun\$, the assumption of an isothermal sphere potential results in an overestimate of the halo mass, and the amount by which the mass is overestimated increases linearly with the value of the NFW concentration parameter. Considerable overestimates of the mass (\$\backslash sim 60\%\$) can occur for galaxy-sized halos, but for rich clusters the mass overestimate is small. The degree to which the mass is systematically in error is dependent upon the cosmology adopted, with a COBE-normalized standard CDM model yielding the largest systematic errors for a given true value of the halo mass.},

abstract = {It is only now, with low-frequency radio telescopes, long exposures with high-resolution X-ray satellites and gamma-ray telescopes, that we are beginning to learn about the physics in the periphery of galaxy clusters. In the coming years, Sunyaev-Zeldovich telescopes are going to deliver further great insights into the plasma physics of these special regions in the Universe. The last years have already shown tremendous progress with detections of shocks, estimates of magnetic field strengths and constraints on the particle acceleration efficiency. X-ray observations have revealed shock fronts in cluster outskirts which have allowed inferences about the microphysical structure of shocks fronts in such extreme environments. The best indications for magnetic fields and relativistic particles in cluster outskirts come from observations of so-called radio relics, which are megaparsec-sized regions of radio emission from the edges of galaxy clusters. As these are difficult to detect due to their low surface brightness, only few of these objects are known. But they have provided unprecedented evidence for the acceleration of relativistic particles at shock fronts and the existence of muG strength fields as far out as the virial radius of clusters. In this review we summarise the observational and theoretical state of our knowledge of magnetic fields, relativistic particles and shocks in cluster outskirts.},

@article{Duffy08,
abstract = {We use a combination of three large N-body simulations to investigate the dependence of dark matter halo concentrations on halo mass and redshift in the WMAP year 5 cosmology. The median relation between concentration and mass is adequately described by a power-law for halo masses in the range 10\^{}11 - 10\^{}15 Msol/h and redshifts z < 2, regardless of whether the halo density profiles are fit using NFW or Einasto profiles. Compared with recent analyses of the Millennium Simulation, which uses a value of sigma\_8 that is higher than allowed by WMAP5, z = 0 halo concentrations are reduced by factors ranging from 23 per cent at 10\^{}11 Msol/h to 16 per cent at 10\^{}14 Msol/h. The predicted concentrations are much lower than inferred from X-ray observations of groups and clusters.},

@article{E98,
abstract = {We present evidence for the existence of shock waves caused by the formation of the large-scale structure. In some clusters of galaxies peripherally located sources of extended diffuse radio emission exist, the so-called cluster radio relics. They have steep radio spectra but no apparent cutoff, as old remnants of radio galaxies usually have. Therefore particle acceleration has to take place within them. We propose that shock structures of the cosmological large-scale matter flows are responsible for the acceleration of relativistic electrons: cluster accretion shocks and bow shocks of merger events. We develop a theory of radio plasma having traversed these shocks and compare it to observational data of nine radio relics (0038-096, 0917+75, 1140+203, 1253+275, 1712+64, 1706+78, 2006-56, 2010-57, 1401-33) and their host clusters (A85, A786, A1367, Coma, A2255, A2256, A3667, S753). The necessary accretion power, the spectral index of the radio spectrum, the acceleration efficiency of the shock, the diffusion coefficient in the post-shock region, and the predicted radio polarization in all of our examples fit into a coherent interpretation of the observational data. Since polarization measurements are available only for four sources, the predictions of our theory can be independently checked using other examples. The predicted values of the shock compression ratio, density and temperature of the infalling gas, magnetic field strength of the shocked and unshocked radio plasma are discussed within the frame of structure formation theory.},

abstract = {The galaxy cluster 1E0657-56 (z = 0.296) is remarkably well-suited for addressing outstanding issues in both galaxy evolution and fundamental physics. We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution from both strong and weak gravitational lensing data. Multi-color, high-resolution HST ACS images allow detection of many more arc candidates than were previously known, especially around the subcluster. Using the known redshift of one of the multiply imaged systems, we determine the remaining source redshifts using the predictive power of the strong lens model. Combining this information with shape measurements of "weakly" lensed sources, we derive a high-resolution, absolutely-calibrated mass map, using no assumptions regarding the physical properties of the underlying cluster potential. This map provides the best available quantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster. We also confirm the result from Clowe et al. (2004,2006a).},
