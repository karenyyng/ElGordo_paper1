The strength of the Monte Carlo simulation by \citetalias{D13} is its ability
to detect and rule out extreme input values that would result in
unphysical realizations via the application of prior probability. 
Our default Monte Carlo priors are described in D13 and in Appendix
\ref{app: results}. We also examine the effects of applying 
two priors derived based on the position and the integrated polarization
fraction of the radio relic of El Gordo respectively. 
We considered other properties of the radio relic to be used as prior
information, such as the physical location. Due to large uncertainty in the
projection angle that affects the prior information derived from the prior
information, we have not included the corresponding numerical results.
\par 
%(Not sure if the following fits best here but it is definitely an intro to
%the priors) 
El Gordo shows radio relics on the periphery of both subclusters
\citepalias{M11}. The
radio relic  of El Gordo was first mentioned in the Sydney University
Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) data in low resolution at 843 MHz
\citep{Mauch03} as shown in M11. The higher resolution radio observation
conducted by \cite{L13} at 610 \mega Hz and 2.1 \giga Hz confirms that the identity of the radio relic
after removing effects of radio point sources. 
Three main sources of radio relic were identified, including the NW, SE and the
E relic. The NW radio relic possesses the most extended geometry among all
the identified relic source. We do not refer to the The SE nor the E radio
relic in our calculation since we do not have an estimation of the shock
speed of the SE relic nor the E relic from \citet{L13} for comparison.    
%Radio relics have been suggested to be able to constrain the mass ratios,
%the projection and the merger configuration \citep{vanWeeren10}. 

%%%%%%%%%% WAIT WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY????
%Ever since the first detection of radio relic, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of
%merging clusters have been used to model their emission spectrum and
%geometry. (\citealt{Vazza11}, \citealt{VanWeerenRJ2011}, Bonafede
%et al. 2013, \citealt{E98}, Br\"{u}ggen et al., Skillman et al.
%2013) While such cosmological simulations have provided valuable insights
%to verifying the physical models, they are expensive in terms of
%computational power and novel techniques have to be invented in order to
%analyze the large amount of simulated data so progress has been slow. 
%Our Monte Carlo simulation can make use of known physics combined with the
%preliminary results from such cosmological simulations to use properties of
%the radio relic to constrain merger dynamics. 

%Compared to hydrodynamical simulations or cosmological simulations, this
%    Monte Carlo simulation is not demanding in terms of CPU time, therefore, we
%    can run many realizations in order to probe how the input variables
%affect the output variables.

%\subsubsection{Weighting function based on the observed position of the radio relic}\label{sec:relic} 
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%Among the known galaxy cluster mergers that are associated with radio
%relics, \cite{Vazza12} noted that most of them have radio relic located
%more than 800 \kilo pc away from the merger center. \cite{Vazza12} then
%conducted hydrodynamical simulations of twenty of known galaxy mergers with 
%radio relic to investigate this observed trend. They found a radial
%trend of kinetic power dissipation increasing up to around half the virial
%radius (r$_{vir}$) of the cluster. Summarizing the results from the proposed model for energy dissipation of the radio relic, \cite{Vazza12} gives the range of highest kinetic power emission in a range of 
%$.2 ~r_{\mathrm{vir}} < d_{\mathrm{3D}} < .5~r_{\mathrm{vir}}$.
%
%
%% In particular, Vazza et al. (2011) showed dependence of observed
%%location of radio relic: when the clusters are at small separation, the
%%Mach number is too high for a radio shock to form and the steep fall off of
%%the emission power of the radio relic as a function of separation makes it
%%difficult to observe a radio relic when it has propagated beyond a certain
%%separation.  
%
%%\textbf{We take into account the uncertainties of their modeling and 
%% construct prior probability on a range of 3D separation for which the kinetic
%%power dissipation of the radio relic is more than 10\% of the peak value.} 
%Since we do not have information on how the probability of
%being able to observe the relic would fall off as a function of emission power, we adopt a conservative approach and designed a uniform prior. 
%%and contrast that to a flat prior to test the effect of the prior on the output variables. 
%We also take into account the uncertainties of the different proposed power
%emission model and come up with a prior of:
%\[
% \text{P}({d_{3D}}) = 
%\begin{cases} 
%\text{constant,} & \text{for 1.0  Mpc} < d_{3D}(t_{\mathrm{obs}}) < 3.0 \text{ Mpc}\\
%0, & \text{otherwise}
%\end{cases}
%\]
% for El Gordo.\par 
%%\begin{equation}  
%%P(d_{3D}(t_{\mathrm{obs}})) = 
%%\begin{cases}
%%1/C, \text{ if }1.0 \text{ Mpc } < d_{3D}(t_{\mathrm{obs}}) < 3.0 \text{ Mpc} \\ 0, \text{ otherwise}
%%\end{cases}
%%\end{equation}
