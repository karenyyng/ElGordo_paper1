%See Menanteau 2012 v1 last section to incorporate discussion of sound
%crossing time of $\sim $ 1~Gyr. 

%\begin{itemize}
%\item I want to compare the radio relic speed $~4300 km~s^{-1}$ estimated in  Lindner et al. to our
%$v_{3D}{(t_{obs})}$ estimate but I am not sure if they are quoting the speed
%in the same reference frame. I need to double check
%%Also we note that from Lindner et al. in press, it is found that the
%%projected speed of the radio relic is estimated to be $4300 \pm ^{800}_{500} \kilo
%%\meter~\second{-1}$. Since the radio relic does not experience
%%gravitational effects to slow it down and is generated from the merger, it
%%can be used to approximate the collision speed.  
%\item I can also discuss the TSC constraint from the observation of the
%depression in X-ray (the wake) using the argument that sound-crossing time is $\sim 1$
%Gyr. This should set an upper limit to the $TSC$, but $TSC_0 = 0.62$ Gyr
%and $TSC_1 = 1.01$ Gyr, I do not think it helps break the degeneracy.
