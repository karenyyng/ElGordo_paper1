Estimates of the period of El Gordo is smaller than both Musketball and
the Bullet Cluster due to the larger masses of its subclusters. 

Talks about how El Gordo is more massive and collided at higher speed than
both the Bullet and the Musketball, so El Gordo is probably a better probe of SIDM properties.

With this new piece of evidence, we find that the absence of an
X-ray shock feature from El Gordo, may not be due to the merger speed being
low, as suggested by \citetalias{Jee13}. 
In particular, taking into account that the estimated projection angle of 
$\sim 41.7\degree$, we estimate the projected relative velocity to be 597
\kilo \meter~\second$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the estimated
line-of-sight velocity differences of $586 \pm  96~\kilo \meter
~\second^{-1}$ in \citetalias{M12}. 

Furthermore, the study from \cite{L13} Lindner et al. has come up
with an estimation of the shock velocity of the radio relic of El Gordo as 
$\sim 4000~\kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$. While this shock velocity is not the
same as the merger velocity, they should be of similar magnitude. Indeed
our simulation found that a merger velocity of $4000~\kilo
\meter~\second^{-1}$ is within the 95\% credible interval.
