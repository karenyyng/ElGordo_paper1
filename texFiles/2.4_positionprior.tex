%how likely each of  the two possible merger scenarios mentioned in section
%\ref{sec: outputs} is true. 
%We make reference to the radio relic data from \cite{L13} in this
%subsection for extending the simulation. Three sources of radio relic
%were identified - including the NW, SE and the E relic. The NW radio
%relic possesses the most extended geometry among all the identified relic source.

We demonstrate that despite significant uncertainty in the time
evolution of the shock, we can compute the likelihood of the
outgoing and incoming merger scenarios by comparing the observed and the
simulated position of the radio relic.
The key to the success of this method lies our ability in estimating the
time evolution of the relic velocity, which gives the upper and lower
bounds on the possible position of the relic for each scenario. The
uncertainty of the time evolution of the velocity of the shock stem from
how the velocity depends on a number of physical quantities, including the
local gravitational potential, matter density, temperature, pressure among
others (\citealt{E98}, Shu .F., more citations?).  The exact time evolution
of the shock velocity requires detailed numerical simulation similar to
\citet{Springel2007}, \citet{Vazza11}, \citet{Kang2007}, etc. 
We draw physical insight from the simulations of the merger shock of the
Bullet cluster from \citet{Springel2007} and \citet{Paul2011b}, which both show
that, right after the collision of the subclusters, the shock speed is
comparable to the merger speed of the two subclusters in the center of mass
frame.  While \citet{Paul2011b} reports the shock speed decreases only
slightly as it propagates away from the center of mass, the Bullet shock
speed mildly drops by $\sim 14\%$ in the 300~\mega yr period after the
formation of the Bullet shock versus a $\sim65\%$ drop for the main
subcluster. \par  
We approximated the upper and lower bounds of the NW relic speed with the
simulated speeds of the NW subcluster.  We simplified the calculation by
working in the center of mass frame where the shock speed is expected to
drop slightly with time. 
The projected separation of the shock is approximated as:
\begin{equation}
	s_{proj} = \langle v_{relic} \rangle (\hat{t}_{obs} - \hat{t}_{col}) \cos(\hat{\alpha})
\end{equation}
where $s_{proj}$ is the estimated projected separation and we estimated the upper and lower bounds of the
$\langle v_{relic} \rangle$ of the shock between
the collision of the subclusters and the observed time as:  
\begin{equation}
	\beta~v_{3D}(t_{col}) < \langle v_{relic} \rangle \lesssim v_{3D}(t_{col}) 
\end{equation}
where $0 < \beta < 1.0$ is a factor that we introduce to denote the slow-down
of the relic. The upper bound can be approximated as the collisional speed of the NW
subclusters due to how the shock is powered by the collision. The shock is
a pressure wave and does not experience gravitational deceleration, while
some dissipative processes may have slowed down the shock wave slightly as
it propogates. It is unlikely that there would be significant energy
injected into the shock to speed up the shock such that the shock travels
much faster than the collision speed of the subcluster. 

We compare the bounds with the observed position of the NW relic  at RA = 01:02:46, DEC = -49:14:43 \citep{L13}.
Three sources of radio relic
were identified - including the NW, SE and the E relic. The NW radio
relic possesses the most extended geometry among all the identified relic source. 
We do not refer to the The SE nor the E radio relic in this calculation
since we do not have an estimation of the shock speed of the SE relic
nor the E relic from \citealt{L13} for comparison.    
From \citet{L13}, the estimated speed of the NW relic is $4300 \pm
^{800}_{500}\kilo\meter~\second^{-1}$. This speed is compatible with our
simulated collisional speed but the conversion of the frame of reference is
non-trivial since the speed is measured with respect to on the turbulent
intercluster gas as a Mach number.

%Observationally, studies from Lindner et al. also provide some
%comparison of the estimated shock speed relative to the gas medium as $4300
%\pm^{800}_{500} \kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$. 

%We simplified the computation of the position of the relic by estimating
%the time-averaged velocity of the relic.
%We treated the lower bound of the time-average
%relic velocity $\hat{v}_{relic} \approx  \hat{v}_{3D}(t_{col})$ due to how
%shock speed evolves over time.  

%We performed two sets of calculation to bracket the possible positions of
%the radio relic.

%In order to capture the major uncertainty in the time evolution of the
%shock, we approximated the time-averaged velocity of the shock with a mean
%as the relative merger speed, and assumed a very wide support of $\kilo
%\meter~\second^{-1}$.

%We denoted the speed in the SE subcluster frame, we take into consideration
%that after the collision, the SE subcluster move away from the NW
%shock(relic) at a deceleration due to the gravitational pull of the NW subcluster.
%Therefore, in the SE subcluster frame, the shock would also slow down. 
%(See figure \ref{fig:shock_evo} for the evolution of the shock wave speed
%in different reference frames)
%The study of the radio relic from \citealt{L13} also shows that the shock
%speed can be consistent with the merger speed. 
%However, since the shock speed was measured with respect to the 
%(See figure X for a distribution
%of the merger speed and how that compares to the observed relic speed) 
%
%The greatest uncertainty remains in the modeling of the time evolution of
%the speed of the shock wave.
