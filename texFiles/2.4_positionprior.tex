%Even though there is a list of standard required data as denoted in section
%\ref{sec: inputs} for the simulation, it is straight forward to incorporate
%new data variables. 
%With additional of data from the radio relic
%\citep{L13}, this simulation is capable of providing a quantitative view of
%how likely each of  the two possible merger scenarios mentioned in section
%\ref{sec: outputs} is true. 
%We make reference to the radio relic data from \cite{L13} in this
%subsection for extending the simulation. Three sources of radio relic
%were identified - including the NW, SE and the E relic. The NW radio
%relic possesses the most extended geometry among all the identified relic source.

%We do not refer to the The SE nor the E radio relic in this calculation
%since we do not have an estimation of the shock speed of the SE relic
%nor the E relic from \citealt{L13}.    
%We incorporate the calculated shock speed of the radio relic as part of
%$\vec{D}$ for the Monte Carlo simulation. 
%We draw  $v_{relic} \sim N(4300~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1},
%800~\kilo\meter~\second^{-1})$ \citep{L13} from each realization and
%compute how far the NW relic would have traveled given a certain TSC in the
%frame of the SE subcluster. Finally we compare the distance traveled
%predicted from the simulation to the reported position of the NW relic at RA = 01:02:46, DEC = -49:14:43\citep{L13}.
%
% this paragraph should really discuss why we are assuming constant speed 
% paragraph 2: estimate the upper and lower bound of the speeds and how
% that is going to impact the conclusion drawn 
% Ambiguity about the speed:
% do we need to talk about that we are only referring to the NW relic not
% the SE relic? Yes! 
% do we need to explain why we are only using the NW relic not the SE
% relic?
We demonstrate that despite significant uncertainty in the time
evolution of the shock, we can still break the degeneracy of the
outgoing and incoming merger scenarios by comparing the observed and the
simulated position of the radio relic.
The key to the success of this method lies our ability in estimating the
upper and lower bounds on the possible position of the relic. The
uncertainty of the time evolution of the velocity of the shock stem from
how the velocity depends on a number of physical quantities, including the
local gravitational potential, matter density, temperature, pressure among
others (\citealt{E98}, Shu .F., more citations?).  The exact time evolution
of the shock velocity requires detailed numerical simulation similar to
\citet{Springel2007}, \citet{Vazza11}, \citet{Kang2007}, etc. 
We draw physical insight from the
simulations of the merger shock of the Bullet cluster from
\citet{Springel2007} and \citet{Paul2011b}, which both show
that, right after the collision of the subclusters, the shock speed is
comparable to the merger speed of the two subclusters in the center of mass
frame.  While \citet{Paul2011b} reports the shock speed decreases only
slightly as it propagates away from the center of mass, the Bullet shock
speed mildly drops by only $\sim 14\%$ in the 300~\mega yr period after the
formation of the Bullet shock versus a $\sim65\%$ drop for the main subcluster, which was slowed down by gravity. 

We approximated the upper and lower bounds of the shock speed with the
simulated speeds of the subclusters.  We simplified the calculation by
working in the center of mass frame where the shock speed drops only
slightly with time. We estimated the upper and lower bounds of the
time-averaged velocity ($\langle v_{relic} \rangle$) of the shock between
the collision of the subclusters and the observed time as:  
\begin{equation}
	\frac{(v_{3D}(t_{obs}) + v_{3D}(t_{col}))}{2}	< \langle v_{relic} \rangle \lesssim v_{3D}(t_{col}) 
\end{equation}
The lower bound is set to be the average speed of the subcluster since the
relic is observed to have traveled further away than the NW subcluster from
the center of mass. The upper bound can be approximated as the relative
collision speed of the subclusters due to how the shock is powered by the
collision. This is consistent with the fact that shock is a pressure wave
and does not experience gravitational deceleration while some dissipative
processes may have slowed down the shock wave. It is unlikely that there
would be significant energy injected into the shock to speed up the shock .
\begin{equation}
	s_{proj} = \langle v_{relic} \rangle (t_{obs} - t_{col}) \cos(\hat{\alpha})
\end{equation}
where $s_{proj}$ is the bound projected separation. 
We compare the bounds with the observed position of the NW relic from
\citet{L13}. We summarized the most extreme values from all of the realizations
for the two possible scenarios in Figure (X), while we leave detailed
results in Appendix \ref{app: merger_scenarios}.

%Observationally, studies from Lindner et al. also provide some
%comparison of the estimated shock speed relative to the gas medium as $4300
%\pm^{800}_{500} \kilo \meter~\second^{-1}$. 

%We simplified the computation of the position of the relic by estimating
%the time-averaged velocity of the relic.
%We treated the lower bound of the time-average
%relic velocity $\hat{v}_{relic} \approx  \hat{v}_{3D}(t_{col})$ due to how
%shock speed evolves over time.  

%We performed two sets of calculation to bracket the possible positions of
%the radio relic.

%
%In order to capture the major uncertainty in the time evolution of the
%shock, we approximated the time-averaged velocity of the shock with a mean
%as the relative merger speed, and assumed a very wide support of $\kilo
%\meter~\second^{-1}$.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item ``In previous work, it has been assumed that the shock
%			velocity is equal to

%We denoted the speed in the SE subcluster frame, we take into consideration
%that after the collision, the SE subcluster move away from the NW
%shock(relic) at a deceleration due to the gravitational pull of the NW subcluster.
%Therefore, in the SE subcluster frame, the shock would also slow down. 
%(See figure \ref{fig:shock_evo} for the evolution of the shock wave speed
%in different reference frames)
%The study of the radio relic from \citealt{L13} also shows that the shock
%speed can be consistent with the merger speed. 
%However, since the shock speed was measured with respect to the 
%(See figure X for a distribution
%of the merger speed and how that compares to the observed relic speed) 
%
%The greatest uncertainty remains in the modeling of the time evolution of
%the speed of the shock wave.
