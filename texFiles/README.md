Comments from Feb group meeting 
======
[ ] means to be done   
[0] means work in progress   
[x] means done    
[c] means computation required   
[?] not sure if I want to do it 
[-] not needed 

Section 1: (3rd) 
--------
[ ] how applicable the assumptions of small parameter and little
self-interaction to this system.   
[ ] wake / double relic <- talk about them in the method section    
[ ] consistent citations  

2. METHOD (1st) 
-------
[ ] 3.3.2 add description of how little the mass estimates affect the
[c? ] 2.3.1 reproduce Ensslin figure and show uncertainty? OK!!    
dynamical parameters from the sensitivity analysis    
[x] insert the data section instead between method and intro?    
Or just rearrange the data first then talk about the method   
[x ] add assumption : ignore mass loss / accretion   
[cx] 2.1.1 plot : choose a different color scale in the middle?  
[c] RA and DEC / use arcmin scale for axes for showing the centroids
vs relic location plot   
[x] we adopted the spatial cut - put it in main text   
[cx] 2.1.1 translate that to a relative velocity difference    
[x] BCG for SE subcluster so choose it as luminosity center   
(I don' think we need to mention this)   
[x] Fig 1. WL info - shifting gapper method - add citation   
[? ] spectroscopic members --talk about completeness - can it have a lot of
contamination?   
[x ] 2.1.3 justify the luminosity peaks are close to the WL centroids
and add uncertainty   
[- ] BCG & luminosity peaks agree well (cite J13)  - not needed    
[x] 2.3.1 specify which exact model it is from Ensslin 's paper    
[x] 2.2 change "incoming" to "returning"   
[x ] 2.3 explain that we explored using position information as a prior    

Section 3 (2nd) 
--------
[x] 3. Results - talk about the table - overview   
[ ] point out the highlights   
[ ] 3.1 stays in result section   
[ ] talk about Sam Skillman 's paper about how long the relic can persist  
[ ] 3.2 stays   
[ ] 4.1 how our returning / outgoing scenario is consistent with other
studies  
[ ] changed figure 4 afterwards for parameters only for the suitable
scenario  
[c ] Mention the period and talk about how far from the recent the
pericenter is, i.e. compute time since turn around (TSC1 - T)  
[x] switch the appendix TSC figure with the one in the main result   
[0] modify 4.1 text to be consistent with the switch between the appendix
TSC figure and the one in the main result -   
[0] also figure captions!!!    
[c ] turn around point in ipython notebook figure 
cartoon for the scenario ?   
[ ] talk about X-ray peak leading SE DM peak by 3 sigma include
uncertainties??    


Intro
-----
[ ] add citations for composition of galaxy cluster ~80% dark matter
Steve Allen 's paper gas fraction ~5% to 20% (good reference?)
Or ... the Peter Schneider book?
