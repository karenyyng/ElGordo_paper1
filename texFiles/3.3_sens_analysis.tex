We performed tests of how sensitive our parameters are to the choice of the
polarization prior cutoff and found that shifting of the cutoff values by
$2.5\degree$ ($\sim 6.4\%$)  would only affect the inferred values by
$\sim X\%$ in the most extreme cases. 

%how does this affect the conclusion of our merger scenario?
