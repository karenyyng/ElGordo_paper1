This paper is investigating the merger properties of the "El Gordo"
merging cluster using$
a wide range of data set. Although the analysis sounds convincing, it
would benefit of a
better presentation so that the reader have a better understanding on
the importance of
various constraints. Once this is corrected, the paper can certaThe
concept of time-since-pericenter is interesting, but it need to be
clarified (the time at pericenter is only defined in section 3.3). I
would suggest that you draw a diagram of the merger (may be at different
time step) so that the reader can have a clearer idea of the geometry
and evolution of the system (on the plot all the quantities used such as
distances and velocities must be indicated).inly be accepted.

Introduction:
=============

Accepted. This information is added on the 6th line of the introduction.

We have made the plot significantly larger.

We will have an overplotting issue if the galaxy luminosity is added.

We asked Robert Lindner for the relic contour but have not received any
reply. The relic size depends on which wavelength of the radio relic
image you are looking at. We referred to Figure 5 and Figure 8 in
Lindner et al. 2014 for estimating the extent of the radio relic and
have double checked that the extent are consistent.

A brief definition is added to line 10 of P.3, the introduction section of the paper.

Explanation of the different merger scenario has been added in the
introduction on P.3 at the end of the second paragraph.
A new illustration has also been added as Fig. 5.

Only the polarization information of the NW relic has been used i.e. 1 best estimate
and 1 uncertainty, is present in Section 3.3. 
The two observed positions used for the NW and the E relic have been added to
the end of section 3.4.
We did not use a Mach number in
our calculation. 

All data and code used in the calculation are hosted on a GitHub repository.
The link to the repository is added to the paper.
This sharing of data and code by this paper is more transparent than most
published papers.

We have moved the descriptions of the
relative velocity data from the first paragraph of section 3.1.1 to section 2.

To be implemented. We have added descriptions in Table 1 for clarification.

Accepted. To be implemented.

We thank the referee for double-checking our calculation. 
(1) The
calculations that led to the results were done with the entire probability
density functions (PDFs), i.e.
carrying out this calculation for EACH of our 2 million realizations,
then we take the biweight location as the estimate. In the referee 's
calculation, only the best estimate (this approach neglects any correlation in the
inputs) was used. Therefore, the
discrepancies can arise from the different inputs. 
(2) We only report to 2 significant figures since some the inputs of the data
did not have more than 2 significant figures. 
Also, the uncertainty
that we give is much bigger than this discrepancy.

> Similarly the $d_{proj}$ I found is 0.744 instead of .74 (based on the
> RA, DEC given)

We also used the full PDFs for computing $d_{proj}$ which is a more
precise calculation.

> diagram of the different merger scenarios.

> Would there be a correlation between beta and TSP?

No. The parameter $\beta$ is not a property, nor an output of each
Monte Carlo simulation. It is a choice of parametrization of our
uncertainty, i.e. you cannot find one $\beta$ value for each
simulation so you cannot compute a correlation between $\beta$ and
$TSP$. The variable $TSP$ is an output and has one value for each Monte
Carlo simulation.

Which specific PDF plots would you like to see in the main text?
Just to clarify, we do not have any likelihood plots but PDF plots since the
Monte Carlo simulation is
a likelihood-free inference process. Both a model and a fit of the model to the
data are needed in order to compute a likelihood. We did not perform any
fitting.
Table 2 summarizes the marginalized PDF of all relevant variables.

The hydrodynamical simulations do not directly give estimates for most
of the output parameters that we have. If we try to compute a table, a
lot of the entries from the hydrodynamical simulations will be empty or
rough estimates that are estimated from their plots.

Accepted. To be implemented in the appendix.
