This	paper is	investigating	the	merger	properties	of	the	“El	Gordo” merging	cluster	using	
a	wide	range	of	data	set.	Although	the	analysis	sounds	convincing,	it	would	benefit	of	a	
better	presentation so	that	the	reader	have	a	better	understanding	on	the	importance	of	
various	constraints.	Once	this	is	corrected,	the	paper	can	certainly	be	accepted.

Introduction:
=============

> more references on cluster merger and in particular regarding the
> typical speed of a merger should be given.

We have added the typical speeds along with some citations on the 9th line of the introduction.

> Figure 1 is key for the understanding of the paper. I would suggest to
> make it
> larger (by rotating it by \~45-50 deg in order to have the elongation
> axis of the cluster horizontal)

This is an excellent suggestion and we agree with the referee about the importance of the figure. 
We did not rotate the figure because there is valuable information in the RA,
Dec coordinates of the various components, so we made the figure two columns
wide instead.

> showing possibly the galaxy luminosity contours.

We will have an overplotting issue if the galaxy luminosity is added. We
did not present any scientific results based on the galaxy luminosity contours.

> Can the relic radio data be plotted on top instead of some schematic
> of it? (it looks like the size of the relic does not match the size
> given in Lindner et al 2014).

We emailed Robert Lindner for the relic contours but have not received any
reply. The relic size depends on the wavelength and the contour of the radio relic
image that one examines. We referred to Figure 5 and Figure 8 in
Lindner et al. 2014 for estimating the extent of the radio relic and
have double checked that the extent are consistent with the outer contours.
The schematic is just to give the reader an idea of where the relic is
compared to the rest of the cluster. We used the numerical locations given by L13 
for all the calculation (See later discussion).

> clarified (the
> time at pericenter is only defined in section 3.3).

We completely agree with this suggestion.
The definition has been added to second paragraph of P.3, the introduction section of the paper.

This suggestion really improves the presentation a lot. 
We have added the different merger scenario the
introduction on P.3 at the end of the second paragraph.
A new illustration has also been added as Fig. 2 to go along with the
definition. 

Section 2

Only the polarization information of the NW relic has been used i.e. 1 best estimate
and 1 uncertainty, is present in Section 3.3. 
The two observed positions used for the NW and the E relic have been added to
the end of section 3.4.
We did not use any Mach number in our calculation and we have explained why
Mach numbers give unreliable estimates of the shock velocities in the center of
mass frame in Section 4.1 paragraph 3. 


> What about the velocity data? It is described in section 3.1.1 but
> should it not be
> moved to section 2?

We have moved the descriptions of the
relative velocity data from the first paragraph of section 3.1.1 to section 2.

Section 3
=========

The table gives all the PDFs that we draw directly from as inputs to
the simulation, i.e. $M_{200_cNW}, c_{NW}, M_{200_cSE}, c_{SE}, z_{NW},
z_{SE}, d_{proj} Table 1.  
We did not draw samples directly from from the radio relic data, so the radio
relic data does not belong in Table 2 which specifies only properties that are
used as the input PDF of the Monte Carlo simulation. The radio relic data
are only used to compute Monte Carlo weights. 

We have edited the descriptions in Table 1 to clarify that the table is only
for input sampling PDFs.

The radio relic data that we do make use of include:
1)  the polarization fraction and the uncertainty ($33\% \pm 1 \%$) which is specified in
section 3.3.1 where the physics of the polarization are explained 
2)  the observed location of the relics (RA, DEC and the separation from the
center of mass) that we used for the calculation for the
different merger scenarios have been added to the last sentence of section
3.4. This particular section explains the motivation and how
the projected relic location is calculated.

We agree that we should provide the details of the simulation but the original
paper did not describe the setup more than having two NFW profiles for
evaluating the gravitational force. After going
through the code base, we have added The description of how the gravitational
attraction was evaluated at fixed grid points of each of the two analytic NFW
halo profiles (10000 grid points each) in section 3, 
at the end of the first paragraph.

We thank the referee for double-checking our calculation. 
(1) The calculations that led to the results were done with the entire probability
density functions (PDFs), i.e.
carrying out this calculation for EACH of our 2 million realizations,
then we take the biweight location as the estimate. In the referee 's
calculation, only the best estimate (this approach neglects any correlation in the
inputs) was used. Therefore, the
discrepancies can arise from the different inputs. 
(2) We only report to 2 significant figures since some the inputs of the data
did not have more than 2 significant figures. 
(3) The uncertainty
that we give is much bigger than the discrepancy between 463 and 476 km/s.

> Similarly the $d_{proj}$ I found is 0.744 instead of .74 (based on the
> RA, DEC given)

We also used the full PDFs for computing $d_{proj}$ which is a more
precise calculation. Other explanations from the previous answer also follows.

> It would be much better to define the output parameters using a
> diagram of the different merger scenarios.

We have added Figure 2 that outlines each merger scenario with the
corresponding time-since-pericenter and the corresponding projected separation
of the two subclusters.

> Would there be a correlation between beta and TSP?

No. The parameter $\beta$ is not a property, nor an output of each
Monte Carlo simulation. It is a choice of parametrization of our
uncertainty, i.e. you cannot find one $\beta$ value for each
simulation so you cannot compute a correlation between $\beta$ and
$TSP$. The variable $TSP$ is an output and has one value for each Monte
Carlo simulation.

Section 4
=========

> described in the appendix, which is not ideal.

We have moved table 2 to be right before the result section and provided an
additional sentence to guide the reader to find the table in the result
section. 
The table contains the key summaries of the results. 
Figure 6 also contains the marginalized PDF of one of the key variables, TSP
vs the relative 3D velocities at pericenter.
The plots in the appendix is only for visualizing possible correlation but
otherwise contain the same information as table 2.


Section 5
=========

We agree with the referee and we originally attempted summarizing the results
in table form.
However, the hydrodynamical simulations do not directly give estimates for most
of the output parameters that we have. 
If we try to compute a table, a
lot of the entries from the hydrodynamical simulations will be
rough estimates that are estimated from their plots and would require
explanation of how they might have under sampled the number of snapshots so
their time estimates have larger uncertainties. 

> And one table comparing the properties of the different merger

In section 5.2, we have summarized the main similaries and differences due to
TSP that can contribute to the
morphological features. We feel like a numerical comparison from a table is
less compelling than the description of the physics at the different merger
stages as in section 5.2.
Furthermore, the Musketball Cluster around an order of magnitude less massive
and is much more further progressed than both El Gordo and the Bullet Cluster. 
The Musketball also does not possess neither the cool core nor radio relics. 
Therefore, we found the
Musketball different enough that we did not
include a direct comparison of the Musketball Cluster in the paper.
